        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Kohinoor diamond, one of the most famous gemstones in the world, has a history shrouded in mystery, legend, and controversy. From its origins in India to its current residence in the British Crown Jewels, the Kohinoor has been a symbol of power, wealth, and misfortune for its owners.</p>
            <p>This blog post explores the fascinating journey of the Kohinoor diamond, its cultural significance, and the ongoing debate about its rightful ownership.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Origins and Early History</h2>
            <p>The Kohinoor diamond was first mined in the <span class="highlight">Golconda region</span> of present-day Andhra Pradesh, India, around the year 1306. At that time, the region was ruled by the Kakatiya dynasty, and the diamond was placed in the left eye of the goddess Bhadrakali in a temple in Warangal.</p>
            <p>Originally weighing 793 carats, the diamond was renowned for its exceptional clarity, comparable to what we now call a D-grade diamond. The Kakatiya rulers believed that only women or deities could wear the diamond without facing misfortune, a superstition that would follow the Kohinoor throughout its history.</p>
            
            <h3>The Curse of the Kohinoor</h3>
            <p>Legend has it that the Kohinoor carries a curse: "Only God or a woman can wear it with impunity." This belief stems from the misfortunes that befell many of its male owners:</p>
            <blockquote>
                "Apart from females, anyone who had the Kohinoor started facing worse times."
            </blockquote>
            <p>Historical records show that dynasties and rulers who possessed the Kohinoor often met with downfall, including the Kakatiya dynasty, the Delhi Sultanate, and the Mughal Empire.</p>

            <h2>The Journey Through Empires</h2>
            <p>After the fall of the Kakatiya dynasty, the Kohinoor passed through the hands of various rulers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Alauddin Khilji:</strong> The diamond was taken to the Delhi Sultanate after Malik Kafur's invasion.</li>
                <li><strong>Babur and Humayun:</strong> The Mughals acquired the diamond after defeating Ibrahim Lodi.</li>
                <li><strong>Shah Jahan:</strong> The Mughal emperor had the diamond cut down to 280 carats, significantly reducing its size.</li>
                <li><strong>Nadir Shah:</strong> The Persian invader took the diamond to Persia after defeating Muhammad Shah Rangila, giving it the name "Kohinoor" (Mountain of Light).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>The Sikh Empire and British Acquisition</h3>
            <p>In the early 19th century, the Kohinoor came into the possession of Maharaja Ranjeet Singh of the Sikh Empire. After his death and the subsequent weakening of the Sikh Empire, the British took control of the diamond through the <span class="highlight">Treaty of Lahore</span> in 1849.</p>
            <p>The diamond was then transported to England, where it was presented to Queen Victoria. To make it more appealing, the diamond was recut to its current weight of 105.6 carats.</p>

            <h2>Modern Controversies and Legal Battles</h2>
            <p>Since India's independence in 1947, there have been multiple attempts to reclaim the Kohinoor:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1953:</strong> India requested the return of the Kohinoor during Queen Elizabeth's coronation.</li>
                <li><strong>1976:</strong> Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan also staked claims to the diamond.</li>
                <li><strong>1998:</strong> A petition signed by 50 Indian MPs, including Dr. Manmohan Singh, demanded its return.</li>
                <li><strong>2016:</strong> A PIL filed in the Indian Supreme Court sought the diamond's repatriation.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Legal Challenges</h3>
            <p>The British government maintains that the Kohinoor was acquired legally under the Treaty of Lahore. Legal hurdles, such as the Antiquities and Art Treasures Act of 1972 and the UNESCO Convention, complicate India's claims. Additionally, multiple countries argue over its ownership, making the issue even more complex.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The Kohinoor diamond is more than just a gemstone; it is a symbol of cultural heritage, colonial history, and national pride for many countries. While its physical journey has taken it from the mines of Golconda to the British Crown Jewels, its story continues to spark debates and emotions.</p>
            <p>Whether the Kohinoor will ever return to India remains uncertain, but its legacy as one of the world's most storied diamonds is undeniable.</p>
