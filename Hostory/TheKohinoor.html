                <p>The Kohinoor diamond, one of the most famous jewels in the world, has a history shrouded in mystery, legend, and controversy. From its origins in India to its current residence in the British Crown Jewels, the diamond has passed through numerous hands, leaving behind tales of power, betrayal, and supposed curses.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section id="history">
                <h2>The Origins of the Kohinoor</h2>
                <p>In the year 1306, in what is now the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh, a group of miners discovered an extraordinary diamond in the Golconda region. This area was renowned as the only place in the world where diamonds were mined at that time, using the ancient placer mining technique near the Krishna River.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight">
                    <p>The newly discovered diamond weighed an astonishing 793 carats (158.6 grams) and possessed exceptional clarity - what modern gemologists would classify as a D-grade diamond, the highest quality possible.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>The diamond was presented to the rulers of the Kakatiya dynasty, who became its first documented owners. The Kakatiya rulers, devout worshippers of Goddess Bhadrakali, decided to place the diamond in the left eye of the deity's idol in their capital's temple at Warangal.</p>
                
                <h3>The First Signs of a Curse</h3>
                <p>Soon after placing the diamond in the temple, a superstition emerged that whoever possessed the diamond would gain great power but would also be followed by misfortune. It was believed that only women or deities could wear it safely.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section id="journey">
                <h2>The Diamond's Turbulent Journey</h2>
                <p>The Kohinoor's journey through history is marked by violence, betrayal, and the rise and fall of empires:</p>
                
                <h3>From Kakatiyas to Delhi Sultanate</h3>
                <p>After some time with the Kakatiya rulers, the diamond was seized by Malik Kafur, general of Alauddin Khilji, when he attacked the Kakatiya Empire. The diamond was taken to the Delhi Sultanate, where Khilji's treasurer declared it priceless and unique.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight">
                    <p>Following Khilji's possession of the diamond, his dynasty collapsed rapidly - Khilji died, his children were killed by Malik Kafur, who then also died, leading to the end of the Khilji dynasty.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Through Various Dynasties</h3>
                <p>The diamond passed to the Tughlaq dynasty, then to Babur, founder of the Mughal Empire. Babur called it the "Babur Diamond" and famously stated that its value could feed all the people of the world for one day.</p>
                
                <p>Humayun, Babur's son, inherited the diamond but lost his empire to Sher Shah Suri. While fleeing to Persia, Humayun nearly lost the diamond when he forgot it during prayers, but it was recovered by a courtier.</p>
                
                <h3>To Persia and Back</h3>
                <p>In Persia, Humayun gifted the diamond to Shah Tahmasp to secure his protection. This marked the first time the diamond left India. However, Tahmasp later sent it back to India as a gift to Burhan Nizam Shah of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate in an attempt to forge a Shia Muslim alliance.</p>
                
                <h3>The Mughal Era</h3>
                <p>The diamond eventually came into the possession of Shah Jahan, who had it cut by Hortensio Borgio, reducing it from 793 carats to 280 carats. Shah Jahan placed it in his magnificent Peacock Throne, said to be more valuable than the Taj Mahal.</p>
                
                <p>Interestingly, when Aurangzeb deposed Shah Jahan, he refused to sit on the Peacock Throne or have a formal coronation, which some attribute to the diamond's supposed curse.</p>
                
                <h3>Nadir Shah and the Name "Kohinoor"</h3>
                <p>When Persian ruler Nadir Shah invaded the weakening Mughal Empire in 1738, he acquired the diamond after tricking Muhammad Shah Rangila into exchanging turbans (where the diamond was hidden). As the diamond fell from the turban, Nadir Shah exclaimed "Kohinoor!" (Mountain of Light), giving the diamond its famous name.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight">
                    <p>After acquiring the Kohinoor, Nadir Shah's fortunes turned - he was killed, his empire collapsed, and the diamond was taken by his general Ahmad Shah Durrani to Afghanistan, where it became part of the Durrani royal family's treasures.</p>

            <section id="sikh-empire">
                <h2>The Kohinoor in the Sikh Empire</h2>
                <p>In the early 1800s, the diamond came into the possession of Shah Shuja Durrani of Afghanistan, whose misfortunes began immediately. He sent his wife Wafa Begum and brother Zaman Shah to Punjab with the diamond under Maharaja Ranjeet Singh's protection.</p>
                
                <p>Wafa Begum promised the Kohinoor to Ranjeet Singh in exchange for rescuing her husband. After much negotiation and pressure, the diamond was officially handed over in October 1813.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight">
                    <p>Wafa Begum described the diamond's value poetically: "If five powerful wrestlers threw stones in all four directions and one toward the sky, then whatever distance was covered—if filled with gold—even that wouldn't equal the value of the Kohinoor."</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>Maharaja Ranjeet Singh cherished the diamond, wearing it on his arm daily and keeping it in the royal treasury. However, as British influence grew in India, they set their sights on the Sikh Empire's treasures, including the Kohinoor.</p>
                
                <h3>The Fall of the Sikh Empire</h3>
                <p>After Ranjeet Singh's death in 1839, his successors met tragic fates one after another, fueling the curse legend:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Kharak Singh (son) - slowly poisoned, died November 1840</li>
                    <li>Naunihal Singh (grandson) - killed by a collapsing gate</li>
                    <li>Sher Singh - assassinated September 1843</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The empire weakened until only Ranjeet Singh's 5-year-old son Duleep Singh remained. The British took advantage, attacking in December 1845 and eventually forcing Duleep Singh to sign the Treaty of Lahore in 1849, which transferred the Kohinoor to British control under Article 3.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section id="british-possession">
                <h2>The Kohinoor in British Hands</h2>
                <p>The British carefully planned the diamond's transfer to England. Assistant Magistrate Theo Metcalfe researched its complete history, including the curse legends, which were widely published in British newspapers.</p>
                
                <p>The diamond was secretly transported on HMS Medea in 1850, facing cholera outbreaks and storms during the voyage. It reached England on July 2, 1850 - the same day Prime Minister Robert Peel died in a horse-riding accident and Queen Victoria was attacked with an iron rod.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight">
                    <p>When Queen Victoria received the diamond the next day, she had a black eye and head bruise from the attack, further fueling superstitions about the diamond's curse.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>The Queen had the diamond recut by David Brewster, reducing it further to 105.6 carats (21.12 grams) to improve its brilliance. After Prince Albert's death in 1861, the diamond was set in the Queen's crown, establishing the tradition that only female royals would wear it.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section id="repatriation">
                <h2>The Battle for Repatriation</h2>
                <p>Since India's independence in 1947, there have been multiple attempts to reclaim the Kohinoor:</p>
                
                <h3>Early Requests</h3>
                <p>India formally requested the diamond's return in 1947 and again in 1953 during Queen Elizabeth's coronation, but was rejected both times.</p>
                
                <h3>Multiple Claims Emerge</h3>
                <p>In 1976, Pakistan claimed the diamond as Lahore's heritage. The Taliban later claimed it as part of Afghanistan's Durrani Empire history. Iran also staked a claim based on its time with Shah Tahmasp.</p>
                
                <h3>Indian Efforts</h3>
                <p>In 1998, Rajya Sabha MP Kuldip Nayar gathered signatures from 50 MPs (including Dr. Manmohan Singh) petitioning for the diamond's return as colonial loot. Public sentiment grew stronger after 2002 when the diamond was displayed during Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother's funeral.</p>
                
                <p>Multiple Public Interest Litigations (PILs) were filed in Indian courts, including one in 2016 by the All India Human Rights and Social Justice Front NGO. However, the Supreme Court ultimately stated it couldn't order a foreign country to return the diamond.</p>
                
                <h3>Legal Challenges</h3>
                <p>The British government maintains that:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The diamond was legally acquired through the Treaty of Lahore</li>
                    <li>It has been part of the Crown Jewels for over 150 years</li>
                    <li>Multiple countries claim ownership, making its rightful home unclear</li>
                    <li>Returning it would set a precedent that could empty museums worldwide</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>India counters that:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The treaty was signed under duress by a minor (Duleep Singh) with his mother imprisoned</li>
                    <li>The diamond is part of India's cultural heritage, mined in Golconda</li>
                    <li>Indian rulers possessed it for most of its history</li>
                </ol>
                
                <div class="highlight">
                    <p>Legal hurdles include the fact that international conventions like UNESCO's only apply to items taken after 1970, and India's Antiquities and Art Treasures Act only covers items taken after 1972.</p>
                </div>
            </section>
            
            <section id="curse">
                <h2>The Enduring Legend of the Curse</h2>
                <p>The belief that the Kohinoor brings misfortune to male owners persists:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Most of its male owners met violent or tragic ends</li>
                    <li>The British Empire declined after acquiring it</li>
                    <li>Queen Elizabeth II's death and King Charles III's subsequent cancer diagnosis in 2024 revived curse theories</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>While the curse's origins are unclear (not directly mentioned in ancient Hindu scriptures but compared to the Shaymantaka Mani legend from Bhagwad Puran), it has been perpetuated through centuries of historical accounts and popular culture.</p>
                
                <p>The British royal family maintains the tradition of only female members wearing the diamond, with the current Queen Consort Camilla being its official wearer.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section id="conclusion">
                <h2>The Kohinoor Today</h2>
                <p>The Kohinoor remains one of the world's most controversial jewels, embodying:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Colonial history and reparations debates</li>
                    <li>Cultural heritage disputes</li>
                    <li>The power of legend and superstition</li>
                    <li>The complex legacy of imperial treasures</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>While its physical form has diminished from 793 carats to just 105.6 carats today, its symbolic weight has only grown heavier with time. The diamond continues to spark debates about cultural ownership, historical justice, and the ethics of museum collections worldwide.</p>
                
                <p>As India and other nations continue to press their claims, the Kohinoor's story remains unfinished - a glittering reminder of our shared, if contentious, global history.</p>
