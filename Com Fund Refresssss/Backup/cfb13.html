        <h2 style="text-align: left;">What is processing unit?</h2>
        <p>This unit is responsible for looking input and after processing it gives output. There two types of
                processing unit-</p>
        <p></p>
        <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li>Microprocessor</li>
                <li>Memory processor</li>
        </ul><br />
        <h2 style="text-align: left;">What is Microprocessor?</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>It is the brain of computer which fetches the instructions at very fast.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It decodes the data and after decoding it sends the decoded data to any other unit for further processing. It
                is also valued as CPU (central processing unit).&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was developed by “Ted Hoff” of Intel Company in 1969 but it was introduced in the market in 1971. The name
                of first processor was 4004, after 4004 many processor were developed by Intel company they were was
                follow 8085, 8085, 8088, 80186, 80296, 80396, Pentium, Pentium pro, Pentium ll, Pentium III, Pentium IV,
                Pentium care, 2d40, pentium el402 etc.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Microprocessor contains mainly two units;</p>
        <p></p>
        <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li>ALU (Arithmetical and logical unit)</li>
                <li>CU (Control Unit)</li>
        </ul><br />
        <p></p>
        <h2 style="text-align: left;">What is ALU?</h2>
        <p>It’s full form is Arithmetical and Logical Unit.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It takes the data from primary memory and after calculating it sends the result to primary memory.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <h2 style="text-align: left;">What is CU?</h2>
        <p>It’s full form is Control Unit.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It controls all the unit connected to PC. It does not take partite data processing.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <h2 style="text-align: left;">What is Memory processor (memory unit)</h2>
        <p>It is that part of computer system which stores data and information temporary as well as permanently.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">There are mainly two types of memory unit-</p>
        <p></p>
        <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li>Internal memory or primary memory</li>
                <li>External memory or secondary memory</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <h2 style="text-align: left;">What is internal memory?</h2>
        <p>It stores data and information on temporary basis because it stored the data in the form of electronic
                charge. It is also called an volatile memory.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">There are two types of internal memory-</p>
        <p></p>
        <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li>RAM</li>
                <li>ROM</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <h2 style="text-align: left;">What is RAM?</h2>
        <p>It’s full form is Random Access Memory.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is real and writes memory. It is also called user memory.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <h2 style="text-align: left;">What is ROM?</h2>
        <p>It’s full form is Read Only Memory.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It stores the data and information permanently as long as computers battery is on.</p>
        <p>Example: PROM, EROM, UVEROM etc.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <h2 style="text-align: left;">What is External memory?</h2>
        <p>It stores the data and information permanently because it stores the data in the form of magnetic charge and
                pits and lands.</p>
