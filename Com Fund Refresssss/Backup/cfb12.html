        <h2><span style="color: #2b00fe;">Sequential and Direct-Access Devices</span></h2>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Several different device scan be used as a secondary storage
                device, but the one selected for a particular application mainly depends upon
                hoe the stored information needs to be accessed. There are two methods of
                accessing information – sequential or serial access and direct or random
                access. A sequential-access storage device is one in which the arrival at the locality
                desired may be preceded by sequencing through other locations, so that access
                time varies according to location. In other words, information on a sequential-access
                device can onyx be retired in the same sequence in which it is stored. Sequential
                processing is quite suitable for such applications like the preparation of monthly
                pay slips, or monthly electricity bills, etc. These direct-access devices are
                also called random-access devices, because the information is literally
                available at random, i.e., it is available in any odder. Hence, a random-access
                storage device is one in which any location in the device may be selected at
                random, access to the information stored is direct, and approximately equal
                access time is required for each location. This analogous to a music CD, if 10
                songs are recorded on a mucus CD, and if you want to listen to (or access) the
                6<sup>th</sup> song, you need not listen to or fast-forward the 5 songs, which
                come before your favorite song. All you have to do is select track number 6 on
                the player, and the player directly moves the pickup arm across the CD to the
                groove where the 6<sup>th</sup> song beings, and starts playing. Magnetic and
                optical disks of various types are examples of direct-access storage devices.</p>

        <h2><span style="color: #2b00fe;">A.) Sequential Access Devices</span></h2>

        <h2><span style="color: #2b00fe;">1.) Magnetic Tape</span></h2>

        <p class="MsoNormal">Magnetic tape is the most popular storage medium for large
                data, which are sequentially accessed and processed. The ½ inch or ¼ inch wide,
                and 50 to 2400 feet long. It is coated with a magnetically redoing material,
                such as iron oxide or chromium dioxide. Data are recorded on the tape in the
                form of tiny invisible magnetized and non-magnetized spots (representing 1s and
                0s) on the coated surface of the tape. The tape ribbon is itself stored in
                reels or a small cartridge or cassette.</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">Like audio or videotape, the magnetic tape used in computer
                systems can also be erased and reused indefinitely.</p>

        <h2><span style="color: #2b00fe;">2.) Tape Drive</span></h2>

        <p class="MsoNormal">A magnetic tape drive is used for storage and retrieval of
                data, which is stored in magnetic tape medium. The tape drive is different for
                tape feels, tape cartridges, and tape cassettes. However, all of them work on a
                similar mechanism like the audio tape recorders or videocassette recorders
                (VCR) found in our homes. that is, the tape drive has read/write heads, and as
                the tape ribbon passes under the read/write heads, the data can be either read
                and transmitted to primary storage, or transmitted from primary storage and
                written to the tape by giving suitable commands to the tape drive. Instead of
                play and record, read and write commands are used with the tape drive. Just as
                in the case of an audio tape recorder or videocassette recorder, a magnetic
                tape reel or cartridge or cassette has to be first loaded on the a tape drive
                for processing. Once loaded, the magnetic tape is said to be on-line, that is,
                it can now be used for storage or retrieval of data by the computer system.
                When professing is complete, the tape is removed from the tape drive for
                off-line storage; that is, it is stored away from the computer system, and data
                on it are not accessible to the computer system, until it is loaded again on
                the tape drive.</p>

        <h2><span style="color: #2b00fe;">B.) Direct-Access Devices</span></h2>

        <h2><span style="color: #2b00fe;">1.) Magnetic Disk</span></h2>

        <p class="MsoNormal">Magnetic disk is the most popular storage medium for
                direct-access secondary storage. Due to their random access capability,
                magnetic disks are the most popular on-line secondary storage device.</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">A magnetic disk is a thin, circular plate/platter made of
                metal or plastic, which is usually coated on both sides with a magnetically
                recording material such as iron oxide.</p>

        <h2><span style="color: #2b00fe;">Storage Organization:</span></h2>

        <p class="MsoNormal">For data recording, the surface of a disk is divided into a number
                of invisible concentric circles, called tracks. The tracks are numbered
                consecutively from outermost to innermost, starting from zero.</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">Each track is further subdivided into sectors for this. In addition
                to the concentric circles, the disk surface is also divided into invisible pie-
                shaped segments. Hence, if there are eight such pie-shaped segments, each track
                will be divided into eight parts, and each of these eight portions of a track
                is called sector.</p>

        <h2><span style="color: #2b00fe;">Types of Magnetic Disks</span></h2>

        <p class="MsoNormal">All magnetic disks are round platters. They come in
                different sizes, different types of packaging , and can be made of rigid metal
                or flexible plastic. Cased on these differences, there are many different types
                of magnetic disks available today. However, all of them may be broadly classified
                into two types – floppy disks and hard disks. Floppy disks are individually
                packaged in protective envelopes or plastic cases, whereas hard disks may be
                packaged individually or in multiples, in cartridges or contamination-free
                containers. Depending on the types of packaging, hard disks are further
                classifies into Zip/Bernoulli disks, disk packs, and Winchester disks. The four
                types of magnetic disks are described below.</p>

        <h2><span style="color: #2b00fe;">i.) Floppy Drive ABCs</span></h2>

        <p class="MsoNormal">Originally created in 1967 by IBM, the floppy reference is
                derived from the floppy media that is encased within the protective casing. This
                media is a magnetic medium and is written to much like the method used by head
                disk drives. Floppy drives have been found in computers for several years and
                are commonly still being used today. The next generations of floppy drives will
                more than likely be the LS-20 diskette drives which are already being included
                in many computers now.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #2b00fe;">Floppy History</span></h2>

        <p class="MsoNormal">8” Disk – the first disk was introduced in 1971. The disk
                was 8” in diameter with a magnetic coating, enclosed in a cardboard case with the
                capacity of one megabyte. Conversely to hard disks, the heads actually touch
                the disk, like in a cassette or video player, which actually wears the media.</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">5.25” disk – 160KB first created in 1976 and later becoming
                a standard in 1978.</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"></p>
        <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li>5.25” single side – 160KB</li>
                <li>5.25” double side – 360KB</li>
                <li>5.25” double side high density – 1.2MB</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>





        <p class="MsoNormal">3.25” disk – created by IBM in 1984, which even today are
                still commonly used. Most 3 ½” newer disks have a capacity of up to 1.44MB.</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"></p>
        <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li>3.25” double density – 720KB</li>

        <h2><span style="color: #2b00fe;">ii.) Hard Disk Drive ABCs</span></h2>

        <p class="MsoNormal">The hard disk drive is the primary storage location where
                data is permanently stored. Below is an illustration of what the inside of the
                hard disk drive may look like. The four main components of a hard disk drive
                are the platters, head arm, chassis, and the head actuator.</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">The majority of computer hard disk drives are permanently
                stored in an internal drive bay at the front of the computer and are connected
                with one ATA / SCSI cable and power cable. Unlike other drives, the hard disk
                drive is the only drive that is not physically accessed by the user like the
                floppy disk drive of the CD-ROM drive.</p>

        <h2><span style="color: #2b00fe;">2.) Optical Disk</span></h2>

        <p class="MsoNormal">As compared to magnetic tape and magnetic disk, optical disk
                is a relatively new secondary storage medium, during the last few years, it has
                proved to be a promising random access medium for high capacity secondary
                storage, because it can stored extremely large amount of data in a limited
                space.</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">An optical disk storage system consists of a rotating disk,
                which is coated with a thin matter or some other metrical that is highly
                reflexive. Laser beam technology is used for recording/reading of data on the
                disk. Due to the use of laser beam technology, optical disk is also known as
                laser disk or optical laser disks.</p>

        <h2><span style="color: #2b00fe;">Optical Disk Drive</span></h2>

        <p class="MsoNormal">An optical disk has to be mounted on an optical disk drive,
                before it can be used for reading or writing of information. An optical disk drive
                contains all the mechanical, electrical and electronic components for holding
                an optical disk, and for reading or writing of information on to it. That is,
                it contains the tray on which the disk is kept, the read. Write laser beams assembly,
                and the motor to rotate the disk. </p>

        <h2><span style="color: #2b00fe;">Types of Optical Disks</span></h2>

        <p class="MsoNormal">All optical disks are round platters. They come in different
                sizes and capacities. The two most popular types of optical disks in use today
                are CD-ROM and worm disks. They are described below:</p>

        <h2><span style="color: #2b00fe;">i.) CD-ROM</span></h2>

        <p class="MsoNormal">CD-ROM stands for compact disk-read-only memory. It is a
                spin-off of music CD technology, and words much like the music CDS used in
                music systems. In fact, if you have soundboard and speakers connected to your
                computer, you can play music CDS with your computer.</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">The CD-ROM disk is a shiny, silver color metal disk of 5 ¼ -inch
                (12cm) diameter. It has a storage capacity of about 650 megabytes. It is so called,
                because of its enormous storage capacity on a compact-size disk, and because it
                is a read-only storage medium. That is, these disks come pre-recorded, and the information
                stored on them cannot be altered.</p>

        <h2><span style="color: #2b00fe;">ii.) WORM DISK</span></h2>

        <p class="MsoNormal">Worm stands for write-once read many. Worm disks allow the
                users to create their own CD-ROM disks by using a co-record-able. (CD-R) drive,
                which can be attached to a computer as regular peripheral device. Worm disks,
                which look like standard CD-WORM disks, are purchased blank and encoded using a
                CD-R drive. The information recorded on a worm disk by a CD-R drive can be read
                by any ordinary CD-ROM drive. As the name implies, data can be written only
                once on a WORM disk, but can be read many times. That is, as with a CD-ROM disk,
                once data has been etched on to the surface of a worm disk, it becomes
                permanent, which can be read but never altered. Moreover, writing on a worm
                disk cannot be done in multiple sections and all the data to be recorded have
                to be written on the disk surface in a single recording session. The same laser
                beam technology as discussed before is used for recording and reading of data.</p>

        <h2><span style="color: #2b00fe;">BUS</span></h2>

        <p class="MsoNormal">The system bus carries bits between CPU and only one
                peripheral at a time. In computer terminology bust three main buses:</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"></p>
        <ol style="text-align: left;">
                <li>Data bus</li>
                <li>Address bus and</li>
                <li>Control bus</li>
        </ol>
        <p></p>





        <h2><span style="color: #2b00fe;">1.) Data Bus</span></h2>

        <p class="MsoNormal">It is an electrical path that connects the CPU, memory and
                other devices on the motherboard in real since bus is a fro up o parallel lines.
                The number of lines in the bus affects the speed at which data can travel
                between hardware components. Since each wire can transfer one bit at a time,
                16-wire bus can move 16 bits at a time, which are 2 bytes. Similarly a 32 bit
                bus can transfer 4-bytes at a time.</p>

        <h2><span style="color: #2b00fe;">2.) Address Bus</span></h2>

        <p class="MsoNormal">It connects only the CPU and memory and helps in locating memory
                address faster. The number of lines in it determines the maximum number of
                memory address. Today most CPU has 32-bit address buses that can address 4GB
                (over 4 billion bytes) of memory.</p>

        <h2><span style="color: #2b00fe;">3.) Control Bus</span></h2>

        <p class="MsoNormal">It controls the direction, flow origin and signals for every
                operation it performs. These signals are used to identify a device types with
                which the CPU intends to communicate.</p>
