new computer users is being infected by a computer virus or programs designed to
destroy their personal data. Viruses are malicious software programs that have
been designed by other computers used to cause destruction and havoc on a
computer and spared themselves to other computers where they can repeat the
process.</span></p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjQn5ckNYNCd0VlHIg6DYTQZS2R4ykhnbZBFi5ZG9QImhqYKfh8SHhuGDUwf-Xf-hSDM2AefALuidYAXT-IF8gXxEANW_nSufqVW6xadIJLwjRr3t7937bS38gvYXZR4SWeM1LXlnROBabkvQgGDoghl7nnufGbag2H3Gb-SBqwWnwLww3xLTxuuF3wxzE/s1024/Computer%20Virus%20-%20Computer%20Fundamental.webp" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="Computer Virus - Computer Fundamental" border="0" data-original-height="1024" data-original-width="1024" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjQn5ckNYNCd0VlHIg6DYTQZS2R4ykhnbZBFi5ZG9QImhqYKfh8SHhuGDUwf-Xf-hSDM2AefALuidYAXT-IF8gXxEANW_nSufqVW6xadIJLwjRr3t7937bS38gvYXZR4SWeM1LXlnROBabkvQgGDoghl7nnufGbag2H3Gb-SBqwWnwLww3xLTxuuF3wxzE/w320-h320/Computer%20Virus%20-%20Computer%20Fundamental.webp" title="Computer Virus - Computer Fundamental" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">A computer virus is a software
program that was first written by Rich Skrenta in 1982 was a 15-year old high
school student. Known as the elk cloner this virus spread to other computers by
monitoring the floppy drive and copying itself to any floppy diskette that was
inserted into the computer. Once a floppy diskette became infected it would
infect all other computers that disk was inserted into, each computer that was
infected would then infect every floppy diskette inserted into it. A computer
that was infected would also display a short poem on every 50th boot.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Computer users can help protect
themselves against computer viruses, malware, and other computer security threats
by installing an antivirus protection program.</p>

<h2><span style="color: blue; font-size: 16pt; line-height: 115%;">What is a
computer virus?<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">A computer virus is a footwear
program that has been intentionally created to cause a user grief, spare to
other computers, or destroy data on an individual’s computer. To help prevent a
computer from becoming infected by a virus, software developers have developed anti-virus programs that stay active on the computer helping to protect it. It
is important to realize that many computers do not come pre-loaded with these
already installed and that if computers do come with these programs, the
programs may expire within 90 days.</p>

<h2><span style="color: blue; font-size: 16pt; line-height: 115%;">How viruses may
affect files<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"></p><ul><li><b>Viruses can affect any files;
however, usually attack .com, .exe, .sys, .bin, .pif, or any data files: </b>Viruses
have the capability of infecting any file; however, will generally infect
executable files or data files, such as word or excel documents that are opened
frequently and allow the virus to try infecting other files more often.</li><li><b>Increase the size of the file,
however, this can be hidden: </b>When infecting files, virtues will generally increase
the size of the file; however, with more sophisticated viruses these changes
can be hidden.</li><li><b>It can delete files as the
file is run: </b>Because most files are loaded into memory, once the program is
in memory the virus can delete the file used to execute the virus.</li><li><b>It can corrupt files randomly:
</b>Some destructive viruses are not designed to destroy random data but
instead randomly delete or corrupt files.</li><li><b>It can because write protect
errors when executing .exe files from a write-protected disk: </b>Viruses may
need to write themselves to files that are exculpated; because of this, if a
diskette is write-protected, you may receive a write protection error.</li><li><b>It can convert .exe files to
.com files: </b>Viruses may use a separate file to run the program and rename
the original file to another extension so the .exe is run before the com.</li><li><b>It can reboot the computer
when executed: </b>Numerous computer viruses have been designed to cause a computer
to reboot, freeze, or perform another task not normally exhibited by the
computer.</li></ul><p></p>

<h2><span style="color: blue; font-size: 16pt; line-height: 115%;">Detecting
viruses<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">The recommended method of
detecting and cleaning the computer from any computer viruses or other malware
is an antivirus protection program.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Alternatively, a user can look at
various aspects of the computer and detect possible signs indicating a virus is
of the computer. While this method can be used to determine some viruses, it
cannot clean or determine the exact virus you may or may not have and is not
recommended.</p>

<h2><span style="color: blue; font-size: 16pt; line-height: 115%;">Virus myths<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Below are some comments we’ve
come across that are common misconceptions when it comes to computer viruses
and other malware.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"></p><ul><li><b><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;">“If I download a file onto a disk, I don’t have to worry
about viruses” - </span></b>This is not true, just because you’ve placed a
file on a diskette or moved a file from a diskette to your hard drive does not
mean that your computer cannot be infected. Many viruses are memory residents
and capable of loading themselves into memory once a diskette is placed in the
computer.</li><li><b><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;">“If I buy sealed software I don’t have to worry about
viruses.” Or “If I just buy registered software I don’t have to worry about
viruses.” : </span></b>This is not always true, just because the program may be
surrounded by plastic doesn’t mean that it cannot be infected with a virus.
When a software program is saved onto a diskette or disc if that computer or
program is infected the virus will attach itself. Although this issue very
rarely occurs it is still a possibility.</li><li><b><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;">“If I don’t download anything off of the Internet I don’t
have to woes about viruses.”: </span></b>This is definitely not true. Although
most companies and web stars will scan the files for viruses before they make
them available to download some may not. In addition, many people crate a site
or a file to download with the intention of spreading a virus, spyware, Trojan
horses, or other malware.</li><li><b><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;">“If I just read my e-mail, I will not have to worry about
viruses.”: </span></b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Not true; there
are viruses out there that are distributed through e-mail; also files can be
attached with e-mail and if executed can infect the computer. Today this is one
of the most common ways computer viruses spread around the world.</li><li><b><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;">“If I don’t get on the internet I don’t have to worry about
viruses.”: </span></b>This, unfortunately, is not the case. Although many
viruses are spread over the Internet today it is still possible to contract a
computer virus from any diskette or disc you put in the computer.</li><li><b><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;">“You can contract viruses from just looking at web pages.”: </span></b>Not
true. However, you can contract a virus if you download and execute a file from
that web page. In addition, spyware and other scripts can be executed from
just viewing a web page. Although these programs are not designed to delete
files on your computer they should be considered a privacy violation.</li></ul><p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">If your computer is infected with
a virus formatting or erasing the hard disk drive and starting over will almost
always remove any type of virus? however, keep in mind if backups have been
made that contain the virus, other media or drives connected to the computer
have a virus, your computer is connected to another computer on a network with
a virus, and/or the virus is stored on some other types of software you use
with your computer it can become re-infected if not properly protected.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: times;"><span style="color: #2b00fe; font-size: large;">Computer Acronyms, Terms and abbreviations</span></span></h2><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: times;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">BIO – Basic Input Output System.
