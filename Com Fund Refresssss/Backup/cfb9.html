<p class="MsoNormal">The third generation of computers covered a period between
1964 and 1971. It marked a new era that was defined by the improvement of the
C.I., that is to say, integrated circuits that were created in 1958, which are
silicon chips or tablets that allow the placement of enormous quantities of
electronic devices in a minimum space, managing to diminish again the size of
the computer and incorporating multiprogramming. Its use revolutionized the way
of building computers, which is still used today in the manufacture of cell
phones and calculators.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;">Third-generation computers had
integrated circuits, in other words, circuits obtained, recording hundreds and
later thousands of microscopic transistors on silicon chips. These devices were
known as semiconductors. On the other hand, the memory capacity of these
computers reached up to 2 megabytes and the processing speed reached 5 million
instructions per second. This generation of computers allowed the introduction
of programs capable of being manipulated by users without technical training.</p>

the third generation of computers<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>The third generation of computers began to be created with
the invention of integrated circuits better known as microchips.</li><li>In 1964, two physicists, Jack St. Claire Kilby and Robert
Noyce were its creators and with it, they revolutionized the electronic
industry and gave origin to the beginning of a high technology era. From this moment
on, events were triggered that made history.</li><li>First, Intel’s hardworking physicist Ted Hoff invented the
microprocessor. Then, thanks to George Gamow, a new way of programming emerged,
and with the discovery of the structure of DNA, the Russian physicist and
astronomer proposed that the sequence of it formed a code.</li><li>On April 7, 1964 IBM announced the S/360, designed by chief
architect Gene Amdah. It was one of the first commercial computers to use
integrated circuits. The 360 was considered one of the most important in
history, as it influenced the design of computers in later years and marked the
starting point for the third generation of computers. </li><li>It is a mainframe computer system designed to cover
applications, regardless of their size or environment (scientific, commercial).
This first group of machines built with integrated circuits was called the
Edgar series, and could perform both numerical and administrative analysis or
file processing. The models ranged in speed from 0.034 MIPS to 1.700 MIPS (50
times the speed) and between 8 KB and 8 MB of main memory. In the design, a
clear distinction was made between architecture and implementation, allowing
customers to buy a smaller system knowing that they could always migrate to a
higher-capacity system, making it a resounding success in the marketplace.</li><li>Control Data Corporation introduces to the market the CDC, a
supercomputer capable of executing multiple instructions per second making it
the most powerful at that time.</li><li>New storage units appear, 9-channel magnetic tapes, and
although some still used punched cards for data entry, they had fast readers.</li><li>The company Digital Equipment Corporation DEC, foreseeing
that IBM had monopolized an important sector of the market, decided to focus on
making smaller computers, which were cheaper and easier to operate, reaching
popularity. At the end of this technological era, the minicomputer emerged.</li></ul><p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>With each invention, the space requirements required by a
computer for its operation became less. First was the creation of transistors
to process information that replaced the vacuum tubes and marked an era (second
generation) considerably decreasing the size of computers by accommodating 200
transistors in the same space. Then, the integrated circuits better known as
microchips were created.</li><li>Among the most important advantages of integrated circuits
is their small size in relation to electronic circuits built with discrete
components. By comparison, an integrated circuit can contain thousands to
millions of transistors in just a few square millimeters, thus achieving the
miniaturization of its components. Thanks to this, the computers reduced their
dimensions, increased their operating capacity (faster), emitted less heat,
becoming more efficient equipment.</li></ul><p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Initially computers handled a single function, either math
or business, but never both.</li><li>The ideas and beginnings of the integrated circuit were
given years before this generation. The composition of this small germanium
device grouped six transistors that formed a rotating oscillator on the same
semiconductor base. They were very economical because they were manufactured by
printing them using photolithography in one piece, and also because they could
be produced in series almost without defects. They were also very efficient
because their energy consumption was considerably lower.</li><li>Thanks to integrated circuits, computer manufacturers gained
more flexibility in the programs, and were even able to standardize their
models.</li><li>Today we can see them in multiple electronic devices such as
cell phones, clocks, television vehicles, etc.</li></ul><p></p>

of the third generation of computers<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Here, we must highlight two of them, the winner of the Nobel
Prize in Physics in 2000, Jack St. Clair Kilby, and the co-founder of Intel and
Fairchild, Robert Norton Noyce, also known as “the Mayor of Silicon Valley“.
The first one was responsible for developing the integrated circuit in 1959.
For his part, Robert Norton Noyce, developed his own, only six months later,
solving some of the problems presented by the model of Jack St. Clair Kilby.</li></ul><p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>IBM 360: without a doubt, the IBM 360 was the most relevant
machines of this computer generation. Manufactured with integrated SLT
technology. It caused such an impact that more than 30,000 units were
manufactured. These computers were designed to cover applications regardless of
their dimensions or use (scientific, commercial). It was a great success
because users knew they could buy a small design that met their needs, and later
incorporate a system with greater capacity. It marked a milestone in technology
industry by influencing equipment designs in the following years. It was the
first computer to be attacked by a virus in the history of computing.</li><li>CDC 6600: with a 60-bit CPU, Control Data Corporation
launches this computer designed by Seymour Cray, known as the first
supercomputer in history. It had 10 peripheral processing units and was
considered the most powerful and fastest computer in the world at the time, as
it could execute millions of instructions per second with a performance of 1
megaflops. The first CDC 6600 was delivered to the European Organization and
its use was mainly for research in high nuclear energy physics (CERN).</li><li>DEC (Digital Equipment Corporation) PDP-8 (Programmed Data
Processor): This was the first minicomputer. Its capacity is 16 bits and was
conceived in Reading England.</li></ul><p></p>
