technological advances that took place during World War II. Thus, the invention
of electronic circuits, vacuum tubes and capacitors replace the generation of
mechanical components while numerical calculation replaces analog calculation.
The computers and products of this era constitute the so-called first
generation of computers.</span></p>

was launched in the middle of the 20th century, specifically between 1946 and
1958, a period that generated great technological advances based on the search
for an aid instrument in the scientific and military fields. These computers
were very notorious and particular for the magnitude of their size and for the
little power to acquire one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in the mid-twentieth century had the first indication or antecedent of modern
computers, but among its main characteristics were its large size as well as
its high cost of acquisition, and the recurrent theme of failures and errors
for being experimental.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: &quot;Cambria&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">The computers counted with the use of vacuum
tubes to process the information, punched cards for data entry and exit and
programs, and used magnetic cylinders to store information and internal
instructions.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: &quot;Cambria&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>The
first ones on the market cost approximately $10,000. Due to their large size,
their use implied a great amount of electricity, generating an overheating in
the system, requiring special auxiliary air conditioning systems (in order to
avoid this overheating). For example, the large ENIAC computer weighing up to
30 tons.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: &quot;Cambria&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">The
first-generation computers used magnetic drums as data storage elements to be
changed later in the second generation by ferrite memories.</span></li></ul><p></p>

generation of computers does not have an exact beginning, since it is the
result of previous discoveries and experimentation from different authors, but
in this case would begin to take its development since the twentieth century.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: &quot;Cambria&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">The design of Charles Babbage’s analytical
machine collected ideas as a primitive way of giving orders to the machine for
the automatic performance of calculations and the introduction of data storage
systems. These ideas were incorporated into the design of the ENIAC, the first
electronic computer to be built. In it, they were later based for the UNIVAC I,
which was the first computer to be manufactured commercially, as well as being
the first to use a compiler to change the language from program to machine
language.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: &quot;Cambria&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">Its main advances were the system of magnetic
tapes, which were read back and forth, and the possibility of checking errors.
The introduction of integrated circuits allowed the appearance of the first
desktop computer in 1974. This immediate success led to the appearance of the
IBM PC in 1981. </span></li></ul><p></p>

Automatic Sequence Controller Calculator (ASCC), where, at the same time, he
relied on Babbage’s work with the analytical machine, managing to build the
Mark 1, the first electro-mechanical computer (1944), which had a speed of a
couple of tenths of seconds to add or subtract, two seconds to multiply two
numbers of 11 digits and divide in a term of more or less 4 seconds.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: &quot;Cambria&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">Eckert and Mauchly contributed to the
development of first-generation computers by forming a private company and
building UNIVAC I, which the Census Committee used to evaluate the 1950 census.
IBM had a monopoly on punch card data processing equipment.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: &quot;Cambria&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">Von Neumann, the first to use a binary or
double arithmetic in an electronic computer. Although his greatest contribution
occurs with the collaboration with Arthur W. Burks and Herman. H. They write
Discussion of the logical design of an electronic computing instrument, which
served as a basis (even today) for computer construction. Ideas such as: the
central concept, which allowed programs and data to be organized in the same
medium (memory) and the use of the first machine to use magnetic tapes, such as
the EDVAC design, Electronic discrete variable automatic computer.</span></li></ul><p></p>

automatic electronic digital computer developed between 1937 and 1942, which
was named in honor of its two authors, John Vicent Atanasoff and his assistant,
Clifford Berry. It was able to perform with a high level of accuracy equations
of up to 29 unknowns.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: &quot;Cambria&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">MARK I: The first electro-mechanical order,
which was the product of Howard Aiken, who based his research in the field,
such as Babbage’s work. Which leads him to be the founder of the ASCC,
Automatic Sequence Controller Calculator. This computer had a magnitude of 15
meters long x 2.4 meters high, as it was made up of about 800,000 pieces and
more than 804 km of wiring. Its speed was not the best, however, was a
breakthrough for the time and later came to build the MARK II and MARK III.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: &quot;Cambria&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">UNIVAC: Universal Automatic Computer opened
the way for the explosive development and improvement of computers that would
be produced. It first appeared in 1951, being the first digital computer for
commercial Its creators were John Mauchly and John Presper Eckert, taking
around 5 years for its realization. It was characterized, like all computers of
this generation, by its magnitude because it weighed 7,257 kg, consisting of
5,000 vacuum tubes and could perform about 1,000 calculations per second, being
quite fast for his time.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: &quot;Cambria&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And
Computer): created in 1943 by John W. Mauchly and John Presper Eckert, with the
purpose of providing help or facilitating problems in the military field, since
it required an instrument that was used as a medium. Its implementation took
about 3 years and still generated a good number of problems apart from its
enormous size and energy consumption required for its operation. In addition to
that, it also presented problems with the programming as it was very complex to
modify, being a model quickly surpassed.</span></li></ul><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;Cambria&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin;">Advantages of the first-generation computer<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
