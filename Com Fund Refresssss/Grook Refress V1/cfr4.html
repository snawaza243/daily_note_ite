            <h2>Introduction to Computer History</h2>
            <p>The history of computers began with humanity’s need for efficient calculation tools. Early humans used sticks, stones, and bones for counting, laying the foundation for computational devices. As technology and human ingenuity advanced, more sophisticated computing tools emerged, evolving from simple mechanical aids to programmable digital machines. This chapter explores key milestones in computer history, from the ancient abacus to the groundbreaking Mark I.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="abacus">
            <h2>1. Abacus</h2>
            <p>The abacus, considered the first computer, was invented around 2000 BCE in ancient China. It consists of a wooden rack with metal rods and movable beads. Operators manipulate the beads according to specific rules to perform arithmetic calculations like addition and subtraction. The abacus remains in use today in countries like China, Russia, and Japan for quick calculations.</p>
            <p><em>Note: Images of the abacus are widely available but not embedded here due to rendering limitations.</em></p>
        </section>

        <section id="napiers-bones">
            <h2>2. Napier's Bones</h2>
            <p>Invented by John Napier (1550–1617), a Scottish mathematician, Napier's Bones (1617) is a manually operated calculating device made of nine ivory strips marked with numbers. It facilitated multiplication and division and was the first device to use a decimal point, simplifying complex arithmetic.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="pascaline">
            <h2>3. Pascaline</h2>
            <p>The Pascaline, or Arithmetic Machine, was invented by French mathematician-philosopher Blaise Pascal between 1642 and 1644. Designed to assist his father, a tax accountant, this mechanical calculator performed addition and subtraction. It featured a wooden box with gears and wheels, where rotating one wheel advanced the next, displaying totals through windows on top.</p>
            <p><em>Note: Images of the Pascaline are available but not embedded here due to rendering constraints.</em></p>
        </section>

        <section id="leibnitz-wheel">
            <h2>4. Stepped Reckoner (Leibnitz Wheel)</h2>
            <p>In 1673, German mathematician-philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz improved Pascal’s design to create the Stepped Reckoner, a digital mechanical calculator. Using fluted drums instead of gears, it supported addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, marking a significant advancement in mechanical computation.</p>
            <p><em>Note: Images of the Stepped Reckoner are available but not embedded here.</em></p>

        <section id="difference-engine">
            <h2>5. Difference Engine</h2>
            <p>Designed by Charles Babbage in the early 1820s, the Difference Engine was a steam-powered mechanical computer for calculating tables of numbers, such as logarithms, using the method of finite differences. Though never fully built during Babbage’s lifetime, it laid the groundwork for modern computing. Babbage is often called the "Father of the Modern Computer."</p>
        </section>

        <section id="analytical-engine">
            <h2>6. Analytical Engine</h2>
            <p>Also developed by Charles Babbage between 1833 and 1837, the Analytical Engine was a general-purpose mechanical computer. It used punch cards for input and was capable of solving any mathematical problem while storing data in a permanent memory, resembling modern computer architecture.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="tabulating-machine">
            <h2>7. Tabulating Machine</h2>
            <p>In 1890, American statistician Herman Hollerith invented the Tabulating Machine, a mechanical device using punch cards to tabulate statistics and sort data. It was notably used in the 1890 U.S. Census, significantly speeding up data processing. Hollerith’s company later became part of IBM in 1924.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="differential-analyzer">
            <h2>8. Differential Analyzer</h2>
            <p>Introduced in 1930 by Vannevar Bush in the United States, the Differential Analyzer was the first electronic analog computer. It used vacuum tubes to switch electrical signals and could perform 25 calculations in minutes, primarily for solving differential equations.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="mark-i">
            <h2>9. Mark I</h2>
            <p>In 1937, Howard Aiken proposed a machine for large-scale calculations, leading to the development of the Mark I, completed in 1944 through a partnership between IBM and Harvard. This programmable digital computer used electromechanical components and was capable of performing complex arithmetic operations.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="impact">
            <h2>Impact of Early Computers</h2>
            <p>These early devices laid the foundation for modern computing. The abacus and Napier's Bones introduced fundamental arithmetic principles, while Pascal’s and Leibniz’s machines advanced mechanical computation. Babbage’s designs introduced programmability and memory, concepts central to modern computers. Hollerith’s punch-card system revolutionized data processing, and electronic computers like the Differential Analyzer and Mark I paved the way for digital computing, influencing fields from science to business.</p>
