            <h2>Introduction to Computer Generations</h2>
            <p>In computer terminology, a "generation" refers to a significant advancement in technology, encompassing both hardware and software that together form a complete computer system. Originally used to distinguish between hardware technologies, the term now includes software developments, providing a framework for the evolution of the computer industry. This chapter explores the five generations of computers, highlighting their characteristics, advantages, disadvantages, and key technological innovations.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="first-generation">
            <h2>First Generation (1942–1955)</h2>
            <p>The first generation of computers, including machines like ENIAC, EDVAC, and EDSAC, relied on vacuum tubes—fragile glass devices that controlled and amplified electronic signals. These computers marked the advent of electronic digital computing and were characterized by their use of the Von Neumann architecture.</p>
