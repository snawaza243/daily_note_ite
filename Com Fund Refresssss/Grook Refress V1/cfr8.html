            <h2>Introduction to Second Generation Computers</h2>
            <p>The second generation of computers, spanning from 1959 to 1964, marked a significant leap in computing technology with the replacement of vacuum tubes by transistors. This shift resulted in smaller, faster, more reliable, and commercially viable computers. The introduction of high-level programming languages like COBOL and FORTRAN, along with magnetic core memory, expanded their applications to business, scientific simulations, airline reservations, and air traffic control. This chapter explores the characteristics, history, inventions, key inventors, notable machines, advantages, disadvantages, and lasting impact of second-generation computers.</p>

        <section id="history">
            <h2>History of Second Generation Computers</h2>
            <p>The invention of the transistor sparked a new era in computing, characterized by technological advancements and increased commercialization. Key milestones include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1956:</strong> IBM introduced the RAMAC, the first magnetic disk system, with 5 MB storage using 50 metal disks.</li>
                <li><strong>1957:</strong> IBM developed FORTRAN, the first high-level general-purpose programming language.</li>
                <li><strong>1959:</strong> IBM launched the IBM 1401, a transistor-based mainframe that sold 12,000 units, becoming a commercial success.</li>
                <li><strong>1960:</strong> IBM released the IBM 1620, a scientific computer with punched card input and a 60,000-digit magnetic core memory, selling around 2,000 units.</li>
                <li><strong>1962:</strong> Spacewar!, the first computer game, was developed, and DEC introduced the PDP-1 for research purposes.</li>
                <li><strong>1964:</strong> IBM unveiled the System/360 series, unifying commercial and scientific computing with compatible software across models.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="size">
            <h2>Size of Second Generation Computers</h2>
            <p>Compared to first-generation computers, which could be up to 30 meters long, second-generation computers were significantly smaller due to transistors. A single transistor occupied far less space than a vacuum tube, allowing 200 transistors to fit in the same area as one tube. This reduction made computers lighter, faster, and more reliable, with reduced ventilation needs. However, they remained expensive, limiting access to large organizations.</p>
