        <section id="window-elements">
            <h2>Window Elements</h2>
            <p>A window is a rectangular unit in the Windows GUI, acting independently. There are two types: <strong>application windows</strong> (for programs) and <strong>dialog boxes</strong> (for user input).</p>
            <h3>Border</h3>
            <p>The border defines a window’s edge and allows resizing. Dragging the border with a double-headed arrow cursor adjusts the window size.</p>
            <h3>Title Bar</h3>
            <p>The title bar displays the window’s name and contains control buttons, located at the top of the window.</p>
            <h3>Control Buttons</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Control Menu:</strong> Located at the title bar’s left, it offers commands like move, resize, or close (icon varies by Windows version).</li>
                <li><strong>Maximize/Restore Button:</strong> Enlarges the window to full screen or restores it to its previous size.</li>
                <li><strong>Close Button:</strong> Closes the window, equivalent to “Cancel” in dialog boxes (introduced in Windows 95).</li>
                <li><strong>Help Button:</strong> Adds a question mark to the cursor for contextual help (Windows 95 and later).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Menu Bar</h3>
            <p>Located below the title bar, the menu bar contains dropdown menus (e.g., File, Edit) for application commands.</p>
            <h3>Popup Menu</h3>
            <p>Activated by right-clicking, popup menus provide context-sensitive options based on the clicked item.</p>
            <h3>Status Bar</h3>
            <p>Located at the window’s bottom, the status bar displays application or system status information.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="file-management">
            <h2>File Management</h2>
            <h3>File</h3>
            <p>A file is a named collection of data stored on secondary storage (e.g., disks, tapes). It consists of bits, bytes, or records, defined by its creator and user.</p>
            <h3>File Structure</h3>
            <p>Files have specific structures (e.g., text files as lines, object files as machine-readable blocks) that the OS understands. UNIX and MS-DOS support minimal structures, while others offer more variety.</p>
            <h3>File Types</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ordinary Files:</strong> Contain user data (text, databases, executables), supporting operations like add, modify, or delete.</li>
                <li><strong>Directory Files:</strong> List file names and metadata.</li>
                <li><strong>Special Files:</strong> Represent devices (e.g., disks, printers), divided into character special (stream-based) and block special (block-based).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>File Access Mechanisms</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sequential Access:</strong> Records are accessed in order, suitable for compilers.</li>
                <li><strong>Direct/Random Access:</strong> Records are accessed directly via addresses, regardless of sequence.</li>
                <li><strong>Indexed Sequential Access:</strong> Uses an index with pointers for direct access, built on sequential access.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Space Allocation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contiguous Allocation:</strong> Files occupy consecutive disk spaces, simple but prone to external fragmentation.</li>
                <li><strong>Linked Allocation:</strong> Files use linked disk blocks, eliminating fragmentation but inefficient for random access.</li>
                <li><strong>Indexed Allocation:</strong> Uses an index block to store file addresses, solving issues of contiguous and linked allocation.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="disk-maintenance">
            <h2>Disk Cleanup and Defragmenter</h2>
            <h3>Disk Cleanup</h3>
            <p>Disk Cleanup frees disk space by identifying and deleting unnecessary files, with user control over deletions. Access varies by Windows version (e.g., via System Tools in Windows 7, 8, 10).</p>
            <h3>Disk Defragmenter</h3>
            <p>Disk Defragmenter consolidates fragmented files for faster access, improving performance. It is accessed via Start > Accessories > System Tools > Disk Defragmenter, typically for the C: drive, and may take hours.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="windows-accessories">
            <h2>Windows Accessories</h2>
            <h3>Paint</h3>
            <p>Microsoft Paint is a simple graphics editor for creating and editing bitmap images. It supports precise pixel positioning, image resizing, and clipboard pasting. Access via Start > Accessories > Paint (executable: pbrush.exe).</p>
            <h3>Notepad</h3>
            <p>Notepad is a lightweight text editor for plain text (.txt) files, ideal for editing system files or source code. It supports minimal formatting, clipboard text stripping, and a logging feature for .LOG files. Limitations include no Unix/Mac newline support and basic search/replace (newer versions only).</p>
            <h3>WordPad</h3>
            <p>WordPad is a text editor supporting Rich Text Format (RTF) with formatting (fonts, bold, italic) but lacks advanced features like spell check. It supports Unicode (Windows XP+), opens older Word files (with limitations), and integrates with speech recognition (Windows Vista+). Windows 7 introduced an Office-style ribbon UI.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="recycle-bin">
            <h2>Recycle Bin</h2>
            <p>The Recycle Bin temporarily stores deleted files, accessible via its desktop icon. Empty bins show an empty icon; filled bins show papers. Files are moved to the bin via drag-and-drop, Delete key, or right-click > Delete. Users can restore or permanently delete files, with “Empty Recycle Bin” freeing disk space. It serves a similar purpose to the Mac’s Trash, recycling disk space upon emptying.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="windows-explorer">
