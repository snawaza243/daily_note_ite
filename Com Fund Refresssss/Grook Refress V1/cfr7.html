            <h2>Introduction to First Generation Computers</h2>
            <p>The modern computer era began during World War II, driven by technological advancements in electronics. The development of electronic circuits, vacuum tubes, and capacitors replaced mechanical components, and digital calculations superseded analog methods. These innovations marked the first generation of computers (1946–1959), which laid the foundation for modern computing despite their limitations. This chapter explores their characteristics, history, key inventors, notable machines, advantages, disadvantages, and lasting impact.</p>

        <section id="characteristics">
            <h2>Characteristics of First Generation Computers</h2>
            <p>First-generation computers were defined by their large size, high cost, and experimental nature, often experiencing frequent failures. They introduced key features of modern computing, though with significant limitations.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vacuum Tubes:</strong> Used for processing and memory, enabling electronic computation.</li>
                <li><strong>Input/Output:</strong> Relied on punched cards for data and program input/output.</li>
                <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Utilized magnetic drums for storing data and instructions.</li>
                <li><strong>Power Consumption:</strong> Consumed large amounts of electricity, generating significant heat, requiring specialized air conditioning.</li>
                <li><strong>Size:</strong> Enormous, often occupying entire rooms (e.g., ENIAC weighed 30 tons).</li>
                <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Extremely expensive, costing around $10,000 or more, limiting access to institutions.</li>
                <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Prone to errors and hardware failures due to vacuum tube fragility.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="history">
            <h2>History of First Generation Computers</h2>
            <p>The development of first-generation computers was a culmination of prior innovations, gaining momentum in the 20th century due to scientific and military needs. Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine (1830s) provided early concepts for programmable machines and data storage, influencing later designs. The ENIAC (1946), the first electronic general-purpose computer, built on these ideas, followed by the UNIVAC I (1951), the first commercially produced computer. Key advancements included magnetic tape systems for data storage and error-checking mechanisms, paving the way for future generations.</p>

        <section id="inventors">
            <h2>Inventors of First Generation Computers</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Howard Aiken (1900–1973):</strong> Developed the Mark I (1944), an electromechanical computer, inspired by Babbage’s Analytical Engine. It performed addition/subtraction in tenths of seconds, multiplication in two seconds, and division in about four seconds.</li>
                <li><strong>John Presper Eckert and John Mauchly:</strong> Built the ENIAC (1946) and later formed a company to create the UNIVAC I (1951), used for the 1950 U.S. Census. UNIVAC I introduced compilers for translating programs into machine language.</li>
                <li><strong>John Vincent Atanasoff and Clifford Berry:</strong> Designed the Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC, 1942), the first automatic electronic digital computer, capable of solving systems of up to 29 linear equations.</li>
                <li><strong>John von Neumann:</strong> Collaborated with Arthur W. Burks and Herman H. Goldstine to develop the stored-program concept, used in the EDVAC (1949). His work on binary arithmetic and logical design remains foundational to computer architecture.</li>
            </ul>
