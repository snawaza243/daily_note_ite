            <h2>What is a Computer?</h2>
            <p>The term “computer” originates from the Latin word “computare,” meaning to calculate. A computer is an electronic device designed to process large volumes of data using predefined instructions, delivering accurate results at high speed. According to the Oxford Dictionary, a computer is “an automatic electronic apparatus for making calculations or controlling operations expressible in numerical or logical terms.”</p>
            <p>In essence, a computer accepts <strong>data</strong>, performs <strong>processing</strong>, and produces <strong>information</strong> as output, making it a versatile tool across various domains.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="data">
            <h2>What is Data?</h2>
            <p>Data is the plural of “datum,” though commonly used as both singular and plural. It encompasses alphabetical characters, numerical values, and symbols (e.g., $, @, +, _). Data represents values, properties, or names of entities. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ram (name)</li>
                <li>26 (age)</li>
                <li>Good (description)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="processing">
            <h2>What is Processing?</h2>
            <p>Processing involves manipulating data based on predefined instructions to produce meaningful results, known as information. For instance:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Input: “Ram,” “good,” “man”</li>
                <li>Process: Combine to form a sentence</li>
                <li>Output: “Ram is a good man”</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Thus, the flow is: <strong>Data → Process → Information</strong>.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="role">

            <p>Computers are powerful tools due to their unique characteristics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Automatic:</strong> Operate independently once started, completing tasks without intervention.</li>
                <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Perform operations in microseconds or faster.</li>
                <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Deliver precise results when given correct instructions.</li>

        <section id="limitations">
            <h2>Limitations of Computers</h2>
            <p>Despite their capabilities, computers have limitations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Intelligence:</strong> Lack inherent intelligence or decision-making ability; rely on user instructions.</li>
                <li><strong>No Emotions:</strong> Devoid of feelings, operating purely as machines.</li>
                <li><strong>Dependence on Instructions:</strong> Can only perform tasks as directed, with no ability to innovate independently.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note: The original content mentioned a “power of remembering” limitation, but this is inaccurate since computers excel at storing and recalling data. Instead, the limitation lies in their inability to process data without explicit instructions.</p>

        <section id="evolution">
            <h2>Evolution of Computers</h2>
            <h3>History of Computers</h3>
            <p>Computers emerged from the need for fast, accurate calculations, with a history spanning over 500 years. Key milestones include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Abacus (circa 3000 BCE):</strong> Developed by the Chinese, also called “Soroban,” it used beads on wires for basic addition and subtraction. Each wire represented a place value (units, tens, etc.).</li>
                <li><strong>Pascal’s Mechanical Calculator (1642):</strong> Blaise Pascal’s “Pascaline” was the first mechanical adding machine. In 1671, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz created a calculator for multiplication. Keyboard-based machines appeared around 1880.</li>
                <li><strong>Charles Babbage’s Computers (1822–1837):</strong> Known as the “Father of Modern Computers,” Babbage designed:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Difference Engine:</strong> Used finite differences to compute polynomial and trigonometric functions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Analytical Engine:</strong> A general-purpose computer with a store (memory), mill (arithmetic unit), and punch cards for instructions and output.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Mark I Calculator (1937–1944):</strong> Designed by Howard Aiken with IBM, this automatic sequence-controlled calculator used 3,000 switches, was 50 feet long, and performed five basic arithmetic operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Atanasoff-Berry Computer (1939–1942):</strong> Built by John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry, the ABC used 45 vacuum tubes for logic and capacitors for storage to solve mathematical equations.</li>
                <li><strong>ENIAC (1943–1946):</strong> The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, developed by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, was the first all-electronic computer. It occupied a 20x40-foot room, used 18,000 vacuum tubes, and added numbers in 200 microseconds.</li>
                <li><strong>EDVAC (1946–1952):</strong> The Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer introduced the stored-program concept by John von Neumann, storing both data and instructions in binary.</li>
                <li><strong>EDSAC (1947–1949):</strong> The Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator, developed in the UK, executed its first program in May 1949.</li>
                <li><strong>Manchester Mark I (1948):</strong> A stored-program experimental machine at Manchester University, with a limited 32-word storage capacity.</li>
                <li><strong>UNIVAC I (1951):</strong> The Universal Automatic Computer was the first commercial digital computer, followed by IBM’s 701 model in 1952.</li>
            </ol>

        <section id="von-neumann">
            <h2>Advent of Von Neumann Architecture</h2>
            <p>Modern computer designs are largely based on John von Neumann’s architecture, proposed in the 1940s. It introduced the concept of a stored-program computer, where instructions and data share the same memory.</p>
            <h3>Features of the Von Neumann Machine</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU):</strong> Comprises the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) for calculations and the Control Unit (CU) for instruction interpretation.</li>
                <li><strong>Main Memory:</strong> Stores both data and instructions in binary format.</li>
                <li><strong>Input/Output System:</strong> Facilitates interaction with external devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Single Path:</strong> A single connection between memory and CPU, known as the “Von Neumann bottleneck,” limits data transfer speed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This architecture remains foundational, though modern systems address the bottleneck with techniques like caching and parallel processing.</p>
