            <h2>Evolution Beyond Fifth Generation</h2>
            <p>The provided content mentions sixth, seventh, and eighth generations, but these are less standardized and often overlap with fifth-generation advancements. Here’s a clarified perspective:</p>
            <h3>Sixth Generation (1990s–Present, Ongoing)</h3>
            <p>Emerging in the late 20th century, sixth-generation devices built on fifth-generation technologies, focusing on personal consumption and internet connectivity. Key developments include the World Wide Web (WWW) by Tim Berners-Lee, enabling global information access.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Laptops, PDAs, mobile devices, multimedia devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Features:</strong> Simplified interfaces, multifunctionality, and internet integration.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Seventh Generation (2011–2016)</h3>
            <p>Defined by Intel’s 7th-generation processors (e.g., Kaby Lake), these computers emphasized energy efficiency, with CPUs consuming as low as 35W. They enhanced mobile computing and graphics performance.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Features:</strong> Improved memory technologies, low power consumption, enhanced performance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Eighth Generation (2017–Present)</h3>
            <p>Starting with Intel’s 8th-generation processors (Coffee Lake), these systems introduced 64-bit multi-core CPUs with significant performance. The claim of starting in 2001 is inaccurate; 64-bit processors were introduced earlier, but eighth-generation CPUs offer advanced features like AI acceleration.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Features:</strong> Multi-core processors, AI-optimized hardware, energy efficiency.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Beyond these, modern computing trends include quantum computing, edge computing, and neuromorphic chips, potentially shaping future generations.</p>
