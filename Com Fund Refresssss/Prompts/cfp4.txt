Create an immersive HTML5 timeline titled "The Evolution of Computing Machines" with Tailwind CSS and JavaScript. Structure the content as follows:

1. **Hero Section**:
   - Animated title: "From Bones to Bytes: A Journey Through Computing History"
   - Subtitle: "How sticks and stones led to silicon chips"
   - Interactive globe visualization showing invention origins (China → USA)

2. **Timeline Component**:
   - Vertical timeline with 9 key eras (4000 BCE - 1944 CE)
   - Each era includes:
     - **Device Card**:
       - 3D-rendered icon (e.g., rotating Abacus)
       - Key specs: Period, Inventor, Innovation (e.g., "First use of decimal point")
       - "How It Worked" toggle (expands technical details)
     - **Impact Meter**: 
       - Visual scale showing revolutionary impact (1-5 gears)
       - Comparison to modern equivalent (e.g., "Pascaline ≈ Today's Calculator App")

3. **Featured Innovations**:
   - **Charles Babbage Spotlight**:
     - Interactive diorama of Difference + Analytical Engines
     - Drag-and-drop puzzle: "Build Babbage's Machine"
   - **Punch Card Revolution**:
     - Animated GIF showing Hollerith card data flow
     - "Try It" simulation: Convert name to punch code

4. **Interactive Elements**:
   - "Compare" tool: Side-by-side view of any two devices
   - "What If?" scenarios (JS prompts):
     - "How long to calculate π on Napier's Bones vs. iPhone?"
   - Mini-game: "Fix the Timeline" (drag events into correct order)

5. **Modern Connections**:
   - "Legacy" callouts:
     - "Abacus beads → Modern GPU cores"
     - "Hollerith's tabs → Big Data analytics"
   - VR tour placeholder: "Visit Babbage's Workshop" (360° embed)

**Styling Requirements**:
- Tailwind for:
  - Glassmorphism timeline cards
  - Responsive grid (1-col mobile → 3-col desktop)
  - Animated hover effects (scale, shadow)
- JavaScript for:
  - Timeline navigation (Intersection Observer API)
  - 3D model interactions (Three.js Lite)
  - LocalStorage progress tracking

**Content Rules**:
- Enhance with:
  - Cultural context (e.g., "Abacus in Ming Dynasty trade")
  - Female contributors (e.g., Ada Lovelace's role)
  - Error prevention: Clarify "first electronic computer" (Atanasoff-Berry vs. Differential Analyzer)
- Add:
  - QR codes linking to museum collections
  - Accessibility alt-text for all visuals

**Assessment Tools**:
- "Design Your Ancestor" challenge (describe a hypothetical 1800s computer)
- Timeline quiz with dynamic feedback
- "Spot the Anachronism" game (e.g., "Would Babbage use USB?")

**Output**: Single HTML file featuring:
- Embedded WebGL models (base64 encoded)
- Print-friendly version (Ctrl+P)
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Completion badge generator (Canvas API)

**Tone**: Story-driven with tech rigor:
- "Napier's Bones weren't just calculators - they were the Excel spreadsheets of 1600s Scotland!"
- "Mark I's 765,000 parts weighed 5 tons - your smartwatch does more with 0.0001% of the materials."
