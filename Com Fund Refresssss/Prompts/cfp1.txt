Create a comprehensive, interactive HTML learning module titled "Introduction to Computers" for beginner-to-intermediate learners. Use Tailwind CSS (via CDN) and JavaScript to modernize the following content. Structure the output as a single HTML file with these sections:

1. **Hero Section**:  
   - Title: "What is a Computer?" with animated gradient text.  
   - Subtitle: "From Greek 'compute' to modern AI machines."  
   - Interactive 3-part diagram (Data â†’ Processing â†’ Information) with hover explanations.  

2. **Core Concepts (Cards Layout)**:  
   - **Data**:  
     - Definition (highlight plural of "datum").  
     - Interactive example: Toggle between raw data ("26, Ram, good") vs. processed information ("Ram is a 26-year-old man").  
   - **Processing**:  
     - Flowchart SVG showing input â†’ CPU â†’ output.  
     - Real-world analogy (e.g., "Like a chef turning ingredients into dishes").  
   - **Role of Computers**:  
     - Responsive grid of 10 sectors (Healthcare, Education, etc.) with icons.  
     - Add modern uses (AI, IoT, Cloud Computing) missing in original.  

3. **Advantages vs. Limitations**:  
   - Comparison table with emoji icons (e.g., âš¡ Speed vs. ðŸ¤– No IQ).  
   - Expand limitations: Add "Energy Consumption" and "Bias in AI".  

4. **Evolution Timeline**:  
   - Horizontal scrollable timeline (Abacus â†’ Quantum Computing) with:  
     - Year, inventor image placeholder, 2-sentence summary.  
     - Key feature (e.g., "Pascaline: First mechanical adder").  
   - Special sections for:  
     - **Babbage's Engines**: SVG diagram of Analytical Engine parts.  
     - **Von Neumann Architecture**: Interactive CPU/Memory flowchart.  

5. **Interactive Elements**:  
   - Quiz ("Which was the first stored-program computer?") with feedback.  
   - Toggle button: "1940s Computer vs. Modern Computer" specs.  
   - Canvas animation showing data processing stages.  

6. **Assessment**:  
   - 5 MCQ questions (auto-graded via JS).  
   - "Explain in your words" textarea with character counter.  

**Styling Requirements**:  
- Tailwind CSS for:  
  - Gradient headers, card shadows, responsive grids.  
  - Syntax-styled quotes for definitions (`<blockquote>`).  
- JavaScript for:  
  - Timeline navigation, quiz logic, canvas animations.  
- Mobile-first design with hamburger menu for sections.  

**Content Rules**:  
- Update all examples (e.g., replace "MRI" with modern AI diagnostics).  
- Add citations (e.g., "Oxford Dictionary, 2024 Edition").  
- Use tooltips for jargon (e.g., "ALU: Arithmetic Logic Unit").  

**Output**: A single HTML file with embedded SVG/JS, no external dependencies.  

**Tone**: Friendly but authoritative. Example:  
"Charles Babbageâ€™s 19th-century 'Difference Engine' was the grandfather of your smartphone!"
