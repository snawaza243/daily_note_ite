Create an interactive HTML learning module titled "Classification of Computers" with Tailwind CSS and JavaScript. Transform the provided content into a visually engaging, modern format with these sections:

1. **Classification Overview (Hero Section)**:
   - Animated title: "From Palmtops to Supercomputers"
   - Interactive 3D pyramid graphic showing computer types by size/power (Micro ‚Üí Super)
   - Toggle button: "Show Timeline Evolution" (1960s Minis ‚Üí 2020s Quantum)

2. **Data Handling Section (Card Grid)**:
   - **Analog**: 
     - SVG of speedometer/voltmeter with hover explanation
     - Real-world example: "Like a mercury thermometer"
   - **Digital**: 
     - Binary animation (0101 ‚Üí ASCII "Hello")
     - Comparison table: "Analog vs. Digital" (Speed: üê¢ vs. üöÄ)
   - **Hybrid**: 
     - NASA use-case diagram (space simulations)
     - Embedded video placeholder: "Hybrid Computers in Action"

3. **Functionality Classification (Accordion UI)**:
   - Expandable cards for each type:
     - **Microcomputers**: 
       - Gallery of devices (Desktop ‚Üí Smartwatch)
       - "Did You Know?" callout: "Your phone is 1000x faster than 1969 Apollo computers"
     - **Mainframes**: 
       - Bank transaction flowchart
       - IBM ES/9000 historical photo
     - **Supercomputers**: 
       - PARAM & CRAY-3 specs comparison
       - Weather forecasting simulation GIF

4. **Anatomy of Computer (Interactive Diagram)**:
   - Drag-and-drop CPU components (ALU, CU, Registers)
   - Animated data flow: Input ‚Üí Processing ‚Üí Output
   - "Build Your CPU" sandbox game (JS canvas)

5. **Assessment Tools**:
   - Matching quiz: "Pair the computer type to its use-case"
   - Scenario analyzer: "Which computer fits? (Hospital vs. Space Lab)"
   - Flashcard mode for acronyms (CPU, ALU, etc.)

**Styling Requirements**:
- Tailwind CSS for:
  - Gradient cards with icon headers
  - Responsive 3-col grid (md: 2-col on mobile)
  - Animated section transitions (Framer Motion CDN)
- JavaScript for:
  - Interactive 3D pyramid (Three.js lightweight)
  - Accordion toggle logic
  - Assessment auto-grading

**Content Rules**:
- Modernize examples:
  - Replace "VCR" with "Smart Refrigerators"
  - Add "Quantum Computing" in supercomputers
- Add real-world context:
  - "Microcontrollers in Tesla vs. Toyota"
  - "India‚Äôs PARAM Siddhi AI Supercomputer"
- Tooltips for jargon:
  - "VLSI: Very Large-Scale Integration"
  - "Register: CPU‚Äôs temporary notepad"

**Output**: Single HTML file with:
- Embedded SVGs (no external links)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Dark/light mode toggle
- Printable cheat sheet (Ctrl+P)

**Tone**: Conversational yet precise. Examples:
- "Your gaming PC is a microcomputer ‚Äì but NASA‚Äôs Pleiades is a supercomputer that could simulate 100,000 games at once!"
- "ALU: The math wizard inside your phone‚Äôs CPU."

**Excluded**: Outdated references (e.g., "punched cards" in modern contexts).
