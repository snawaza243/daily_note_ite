You are an expert in computer networks, technical writing, and web development, tasked with creating a detailed tutorial chapter for a blog series titled "Computer Networks: From Scratch to Mastery." The series is designed for CSE graduates and professionals, covering 12 chapters across 4 modules: Foundations of Networking, Protocols & Addressing, Advanced Networking, and Real-World Applications. Generate a comprehensive tutorial for Chapter 2, adhering to the following guidelines:

1. **Content Requirements**:
   - Provide an in-depth explanation of the chapter’s topics, including theoretical concepts, practical applications, and real-world examples, tailored for both beginners and advanced learners.
   - Cover the following subtopics thoroughly:
     - **OSI Model (7 Layers Explained)**: Describe each of the seven layers (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application) in detail, including their functions, protocols, and examples of devices or software operating at each layer. Explain the purpose of the OSI model as a conceptual framework.
     - **TCP/IP Model (vs OSI)**: Describe the TCP/IP model (Link, Internet, Transport, Application layers), its structure, and key differences from the OSI model. Highlight practical applications and protocol mappings (e.g., IP at Internet layer, TCP/UDP at Transport layer).
     - **IEEE and IETF Standards**: Explain the roles of IEEE (e.g., 802.3 Ethernet, 802.11 Wi-Fi) and IETF (e.g., RFCs for IP, TCP), including their contributions to networking standards. Provide examples of key standards and their impact.
     - **Encapsulation and Decapsulation Process**: Detail the process of encapsulation (data packaging from Application to Physical layer) and decapsulation (unpacking from Physical to Application layer), including headers, payloads, and protocol data units (PDUs) at each layer.
   - Define key terms (e.g., OSI model, protocol, encapsulation, RFC) and explain their significance.
   - Break down complex concepts into clear, beginner-friendly explanations while maintaining technical depth for advanced learners.
   - Include at least two practical examples:
     - A step-by-step example demonstrating a network concept, such as analyzing a packet’s journey through OSI layers using Wireshark or a similar tool.
     - A visual example using HTML canvas or HTML elements to illustrate a concept (e.g., a canvas-based diagram of the OSI or TCP/IP model layers, or an animation of the encapsulation/decapsulation process showing data flow).
   - Highlight common pitfalls (e.g., confusing OSI and TCP/IP layers), troubleshooting tips (e.g., identifying layer-specific issues), and best practices (e.g., adhering to standards for interoperability).
   - Ensure content builds on Chapter 1 (Introduction to Computer Networks) and aligns with the module goal: "Understand core concepts, models, and physical infrastructure."

2. **Structure**:
   - **Introduction**: Outline the chapter’s objectives, importance in understanding network models and standards, and its role in the Foundations of Networking module.
   - **Main Sections**: Organize content into logical sections with clear headings (H2, H3 in HTML) for each subtopic:
     - The OSI Model: Understanding the 7 Layers
     - The TCP/IP Model: Structure and Comparison with OSI
     - IEEE and IETF Standards: Shaping Network Protocols
     - Encapsulation and Decapsulation: Data Flow Across Layers
     - Practical Example 1: Analyzing Packet Flow with Wireshark
     - Practical Example 2: Visualizing OSI Layers or Encapsulation with HTML Canvas or HTML
   - **Summary**: Provide key takeaways, reinforcing learning objectives and summarizing key concepts.
   - **Further Reading**: List reputable resources (e.g., “Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach” by Kurose and Ross, Cisco Networking Academy, RFC 791 for IP, RFC 793 for TCP).
   - **Navigation**: Include links to the landing page, previous chapter (Chapter 1), next chapter (Chapter 3), and all modules.

3. **Technical Accuracy**:
   - Ensure all information is factually correct and up-to-date as of May 18, 2025.
   - Reference standard protocols and standards (e.g., IEEE 802.3 for Ethernet, RFC 791 for IP, RFC 793 for TCP).
   - Avoid outdated technologies unless relevant for context (e.g., historical protocols like X.25).
   - Use accurate terminology (e.g., “PDU” for protocol data unit, “segment” for Transport layer data).

4. **Output Format**:
   - Generate content in valid HTML, styled exclusively with Tailwind CSS classes (CDN: https://cdn.tailwindcss.com).
   - **Prohibit inline CSS**: Do not use inline styles (e.g., style="...") under any circumstances.
   - Use semantic HTML tags (e.g., <section>, <article>, <h1>, <h2>, <p>, <ul>, <code>).
   - Ensure responsiveness for desktop and mobile devices using Tailwind’s responsive classes (e.g., sm:, md:, lg:).
   - Include a navigation bar linking to the landing page and all modules (Module 1: Foundations of Networking, Module 2: Protocols & Addressing, Module 3: Advanced Networking, Module 4: Real-World Applications).
   - Wrap code snippets (e.g., Wireshark commands, JavaScript for canvas) in <pre><code> tags with appropriate language classes (e.g., language-text, language-javascript).
   - For the canvas/HTML example, include JavaScript within a <script> tag to render a visual representation (e.g., drawing OSI layers as stacked rectangles or animating encapsulation with data packets moving through layers). Use <canvas> or HTML elements (e.g., <div> or <svg> for layers) styled with Tailwind classes.
   - Use Tailwind classes for consistent styling (e.g., bg-white, p-6, text-lg, rounded-lg, shadow-md, hover:bg-blue-700).
   - Structure the HTML with a header, navigation bar, main content, and footer, ensuring the output is ready for direct publishing on a blog platform.

5. **Canvas/HTML Example Guidelines**:
   - Create a visual example using HTML canvas or HTML elements to illustrate a concept from the chapter (e.g., a diagram of the OSI or TCP/IP model layers, or an animation of the encapsulation/decapsulation process).
   - For canvas: Use JavaScript to draw shapes (e.g., rectangles for OSI layers, arrows for data flow) and label them (e.g., “Application Layer”, “Physical Layer”).
   - For HTML elements: Use <div> or <svg> to represent layers or packets, styled with Tailwind classes for positioning and appearance.
   - Ensure the example is visually clear, with a brief explanation of the code and its relevance to the topic.
   - Include a fallback text description for accessibility (e.g., describing the OSI layer stack or encapsulation flow).

6. **Tone and Style**:
   - Use a professional, engaging tone suitable for a technical tutorial series.
   - Define jargon clearly (e.g., OSI, encapsulation, RFC) and maintain consistency in terminology across the series.
   - Write for clarity, avoiding ambiguity, and cater to both beginners and advanced learners.

7. **Chapter Details**:
   - Module: Module 1: Foundations of Networking
   - Chapter Title: Network Models & Standards
   - Chapter Number: Chapter 2
   - Topics to Cover:
