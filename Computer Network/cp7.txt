You are an expert in computer networks, cybersecurity, technical writing, and web development, tasked with creating a detailed tutorial chapter for a blog series titled "Computer Networks: From Scratch to Mastery." The series is designed for CSE graduates and professionals, covering 12 chapters across 4 modules: Foundations of Networking, Protocols & Addressing, Advanced Networking, and Real-World Applications. Generate a comprehensive tutorial for Chapter 7, adhering to the following guidelines:

1. **Content Requirements**:
   - Provide an in-depth explanation of the chapter’s topics, including theoretical concepts, practical applications, and real-world examples, tailored for both beginners and advanced learners.
   - Cover the following subtopics thoroughly:
     - **Firewalls, IDS/IPS**:
       - **Firewalls**: Explain packet-filtering, stateful, and next-generation firewalls, their roles in controlling traffic, and rule-based configurations.
       - **IDS/IPS**: Describe Intrusion Detection Systems (signature-based, anomaly-based) and Intrusion Prevention Systems, including their placement in networks and response mechanisms.
     - **Cryptography (SSL/TLS, AES)**:
       - **SSL/TLS**: Detail Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security for securing communications (e.g., HTTPS), including handshake processes and certificate authorities.
       - **AES**: Explain Advanced Encryption Standard for symmetric encryption, key sizes (128, 256 bits), and applications (e.g., VPNs, disk encryption).
     - **Authentication Methods (2FA, Biometrics)**:
       - **2FA**: Describe two-factor authentication (e.g., password + SMS code, authenticator apps) and its role in enhancing security.
       - **Biometrics**: Discuss biometric authentication (e.g., fingerprint, facial recognition), advantages, and privacy concerns.
     - **Network Security Best Practices**: Outline practices like regular patching, least privilege, network segmentation, and security audits.
     - **VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)**: Explain VPNs for secure remote access, including protocols (e.g., OpenVPN, IPsec) and use cases (e.g., remote work, bypassing geo-restrictions).
     - **Network Access Control (NAC)**: Describe NAC for enforcing security policies, including device authentication and compliance checks before granting network access.
     - **Threat Detection and Mitigation**: Discuss techniques for identifying threats (e.g., malware, DDoS attacks) and mitigation strategies (e.g., rate limiting, SIEM systems).
   - Define key terms (e.g., firewall, encryption, 2FA, VPN) and explain their significance.
   - Break down complex concepts into clear, beginner-friendly explanations while maintaining technical depth for advanced learners.
   - Include at least two practical examples:
     - A step-by-step example, such as configuring a firewall rule or setting up a VPN in Cisco Packet Tracer or pfSense.
     - A visual example using HTML canvas or HTML elements to illustrate a concept (e.g., a canvas-based diagram of a firewall filtering traffic, an SSL/TLS handshake, or a NAC process).
   - Highlight common pitfalls (e.g., overly permissive firewall rules, weak encryption keys), troubleshooting tips (e.g., checking firewall logs, verifying VPN connectivity), and best practices (e.g., using strong ciphers for SSL/TLS, enabling 2FA for all users).
   - Ensure content builds on Chapters 1 (Introduction to Computer Networks), 2 (Network Models & Standards), 3 (Transmission Media & Hardware), 4 (IP Addressing Basics), 5 (Key Networking Protocols), and 6 (Routing & Switching) and aligns with the module goal: "Explore advanced networking concepts, security, and management."

2. **Structure**:
   - **Introduction**: Outline the chapter’s objectives, importance in understanding network security, and its role in the Advanced Networking module.
   - **Main Sections**: Organize content into logical sections with clear headings (H2, H3 in HTML) for each subtopic:
     - Firewalls and IDS/IPS: Protecting Network Perimeters
     - Cryptography: Securing Data with SSL/TLS and AES
     - Authentication Methods: 2FA and Biometrics
     - Network Security Best Practices: Building a Secure Network
     - VPNs: Secure Remote Access
     - Network Access Control: Enforcing Security Policies
     - Threat Detection and Mitigation: Responding to Attacks
     - Practical Example 1: Configuring a Firewall or VPN
     - Practical Example 2: Visualizing Firewall or SSL/TLS Handshake with HTML Canvas or HTML
   - **Summary**: Provide key takeaways, reinforcing learning objectives and summarizing key concepts.
   - **Further Reading**: List reputable resources (e.g., “Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach” by Kurose and Ross, Cisco Networking Academy, RFC 5246 for TLS, NIST SP 800-38A for AES).
   - **Navigation**: Include links to the landing page, previous chapter (Chapter 6), next chapter (Chapter 8), and all modules.

3. **Technical Accuracy**:
   - Ensure all information is factually correct and up-to-date as of May 18, 2025.
   - Reference standard protocols and standards (e.g., RFC 5246 for TLS, RFC 4301 for IPsec, NIST SP 800-38A for AES).
   - Avoid outdated technologies unless relevant for context (e.g., SSLv3 for historical purposes).
   - Use accurate terminology (e.g., “stateful inspection” for firewalls, “symmetric encryption” for AES, “NAC posture assessment” for NAC).

4. **Output Format**:
   - Generate content in valid HTML, styled exclusively with Tailwind CSS classes (CDN: https://cdn.tailwindcss.com).
   - **Prohibit inline CSS**: Do not use inline styles (e.g., style="...") under any circumstances.
   - Use semantic HTML tags (e.g., <section>, <article>, <h1>, <h2>, <p>, <ul>, <code>).
   - Ensure responsiveness for desktop and mobile devices using Tailwind’s responsive classes (e.g., sm:, md:, lg:).
   - Include a navigation bar linking to the landing page and all modules (Module 1: Foundations of Networking, Module 2: Protocols & Addressing, Module 3: Advanced Networking, Module 4: Real-World Applications).
   - Wrap code snippets (e.g., firewall rules, JavaScript for canvas) in <pre><code> tags with appropriate language classes (e.g., language-text, language-javascript).
   - For the canvas/HTML example, include JavaScript within a <script> tag to render a visual representation (e.g., drawing a firewall filtering traffic, an SSL/TLS handshake with client/server, or a NAC authentication process). Use <canvas> or HTML elements (e.g., <div> or <svg> for devices) styled with Tailwind classes.
   - Use Tailwind classes for consistent styling (e.g., bg-white, p-6, text-lg, rounded-lg, shadow-md, hover:bg-blue-700).
   - Structure the HTML with a header, navigation bar, main content, and footer, ensuring the output is ready for direct publishing on a blog platform.

5. **Canvas/HTML Example Guidelines**:
   - Create a visual example using HTML canvas or HTML elements to illustrate a concept from the chapter (e.g., a diagram of a firewall filtering inbound/outbound traffic, an SSL/TLS handshake with certificate exchange, or a NAC process with device authentication).
   - For canvas: Use JavaScript to draw shapes (e.g., rectangles for firewalls, arrows for traffic flow, circles for clients/servers) and label them (e.g., “Permit HTTP”, “Client”).
   - For HTML elements: Use <div> or <svg> to represent devices or processes, styled with Tailwind classes for positioning and appearance.
   - Ensure the example is visually clear, with a brief explanation of the code and its relevance to the topic.
   - Include a fallback text description for accessibility (e.g., describing the firewall rules or SSL/TLS handshake).

6. **Tone and Style**:
   - Use a professional, engaging tone suitable for a technical tutorial series.
   - Define jargon clearly (e.g., firewall, TLS, NAC) and maintain consistency in terminology across the series.
   - Write for clarity, avoiding ambiguity, and cater to both beginners and advanced learners.
