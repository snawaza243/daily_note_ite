You are an expert in computer networks, technical writing, and web development, tasked with creating a detailed tutorial chapter for a blog series titled "Computer Networks: From Scratch to Mastery." The series is designed for CSE graduates and professionals, covering 12 chapters across 4 modules: Foundations of Networking, Protocols & Addressing, Advanced Networking, and Real-World Applications. Generate a comprehensive tutorial for Chapter 6, adhering to the following guidelines:

1. **Content Requirements**:
   - Provide an in-depth explanation of the chapter’s topics, including theoretical concepts, practical applications, and real-world examples, tailored for both beginners and advanced learners.
   - Cover the following subtopics thoroughly:
     - **Routing Algorithms**:
       - **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**: Distance-vector protocol, hop count metric, limitations (e.g., 15-hop limit).
       - **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**: Link-state protocol, Dijkstra’s algorithm, areas, and scalability.
       - **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**: Path-vector protocol, used in inter-domain routing (e.g., internet backbone).
     - **VLANs and MAC Addresses**: Explain Virtual LANs (VLANs) for network segmentation, including VLAN tagging (IEEE 802.1Q). Describe MAC addresses, their role in Layer 2 switching, and the MAC address table.
     - **Switching Techniques**:
       - **Store & Forward**: Buffers entire frame, checks for errors, used in modern switches.
       - **Cut-through**: Forwards frame after reading destination address, lower latency but no error checking.
     - **Static vs Dynamic Routing**: Compare static routing (manually configured, simple but inflexible) with dynamic routing (adaptive, uses protocols like RIP, OSPF), including pros and cons.
     - **Routing Tables**: Describe the structure and role of routing tables in routers, including fields (destination, next hop, metric) and how they are populated.
     - **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)**: Explain STP (IEEE 802.1D) for preventing loops in switched networks, including root bridge election and port states (Blocking, Listening, Learning, Forwarding).
     - **Quality of Service (QoS) in Routing and Switching**: Discuss QoS mechanisms (e.g., traffic prioritization, bandwidth allocation) to ensure performance for critical applications.
   - Define key terms (e.g., routing, VLAN, STP, QoS) and explain their significance.
   - Break down complex concepts into clear, beginner-friendly explanations while maintaining technical depth for advanced learners.
   - Include at least two practical examples:
     - A step-by-step example, such as configuring OSPF or VLANs on a router/switch in Cisco Packet Tracer.
     - A visual example using HTML canvas or HTML elements to illustrate a concept (e.g., a canvas-based diagram of an OSPF network, a VLAN topology, or the STP process).
   - Highlight common pitfalls (e.g., routing loops, VLAN misconfiguration), troubleshooting tips (e.g., using `show vlan brief` for VLAN issues, checking routing tables with `show ip route`), and best practices (e.g., using OSPF for large networks, enabling QoS for VoIP).
   - Ensure content builds on Chapters 1 (Introduction to Computer Networks), 2 (Network Models & Standards), 3 (Transmission Media & Hardware), 4 (IP Addressing Basics), and 5 (Key Networking Protocols) and aligns with the module goal: "Master IP addressing, protocols, and data flow."

2. **Structure**:
   - **Introduction**: Outline the chapter’s objectives, importance in understanding routing and switching, and its role in the Protocols & Addressing module.
   - **Main Sections**: Organize content into logical sections with clear headings (H2, H3 in HTML) for each subtopic:
     - Routing Algorithms: RIP, OSPF, and BGP
     - VLANs and MAC Addresses: Segmenting and Addressing at Layer 2
     - Switching Techniques: Store & Forward vs Cut-through
     - Static vs Dynamic Routing: Configuring Network Paths
     - Routing Tables: Directing Packet Flow
     - Spanning Tree Protocol: Preventing Network Loops
     - Quality of Service: Optimizing Network Performance
     - Practical Example 1: Configuring OSPF or VLANs in Packet Tracer
     - Practical Example 2: Visualizing OSPF Network or STP with HTML Canvas or HTML
   - **Summary**: Provide key takeaways, reinforcing learning objectives and summarizing key concepts.
   - **Further Reading**: List reputable resources (e.g., “Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach” by Kurose and Ross, Cisco Networking Academy, RFC 2328 for OSPF, RFC 4271 for BGP).
   - **Navigation**: Include links to the landing page, previous chapter (Chapter 5), next chapter (Chapter 7), and all modules.

3. **Technical Accuracy**:
   - Ensure all information is factually correct and up-to-date as of May 18, 2025.
   - Reference standard protocols and standards (e.g., RFC 1058 for RIP, RFC 2328 for OSPF, RFC 4271 for BGP, IEEE 802.1Q for VLANs, IEEE 802.1D for STP).
   - Avoid outdated technologies unless relevant for context (e.g., RIP version 1 for historical purposes).
   - Use accurate terminology (e.g., “link-state” for OSPF, “VLAN ID” for VLANs, “root bridge” for STP).

4. **Output Format**:
   - Generate content in valid HTML, styled exclusively with Tailwind CSS classes (CDN: https://cdn.tailwindcss.com).
   - **Prohibit inline CSS**: Do not use inline styles (e.g., style="...") under any circumstances.
   - Use semantic HTML tags (e.g., <section>, <article>, <h1>, <h2>, <p>, <ul>, <code>).
   - Ensure responsiveness for desktop and mobile devices using Tailwind’s responsive classes (e.g., sm:, md:, lg:).
   - Include a navigation bar linking to the landing page and all modules (Module 1: Foundations of Networking, Module 2: Protocols & Addressing, Module 3: Advanced Networking, Module 4: Real-World Applications).
   - Wrap code snippets (e.g., Packet Tracer commands, JavaScript for canvas) in <pre><code> tags with appropriate language classes (e.g., language-text, language-javascript).
   - For the canvas/HTML example, include JavaScript within a <script> tag to render a visual representation (e.g., drawing an OSPF network with routers and areas, a VLAN topology with switches and PCs, or the STP process with bridges). Use <canvas> or HTML elements (e.g., <div> or <svg> for network devices) styled with Tailwind classes.
   - Use Tailwind classes for consistent styling (e.g., bg-white, p-6, text-lg, rounded-lg, shadow-md, hover:bg-blue-700).
   - Structure the HTML with a header, navigation bar, main content, and footer, ensuring the output is ready for direct publishing on a blog platform.

5. **Canvas/HTML Example Guidelines**:
   - Create a visual example using HTML canvas or HTML elements to illustrate a concept from the chapter (e.g., a diagram of an OSPF network with routers and links, a VLAN topology with tagged frames, or the STP process showing blocked ports).
   - For canvas: Use JavaScript to draw shapes (e.g., circles for routers, lines for links, rectangles for VLANs) and label them (e.g., “Router 1”, “VLAN 10”).
   - For HTML elements: Use <div> or <svg> to represent devices or VLANs, styled with Tailwind classes for positioning and appearance.
   - Ensure the example is visually clear, with a brief explanation of the code and its relevance to the topic.
   - Include a fallback text description for accessibility (e.g., describing the OSPF network or STP topology).

6. **Tone and Style**:
   - Use a professional, engaging tone suitable for a technical tutorial series.
   - Define jargon clearly (e.g., routing, VLAN, STP) and maintain consistency in terminology across the series.
   - Write for clarity, avoiding ambiguity, and cater to both beginners and advanced learners.
