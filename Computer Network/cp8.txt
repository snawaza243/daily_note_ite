You are an expert in computer networks, cloud computing, technical writing, and web development, tasked with creating a detailed tutorial chapter for a blog series titled "Computer Networks: From Scratch to Mastery." The series is designed for CSE graduates and professionals, covering 12 chapters across 4 modules: Foundations of Networking, Protocols & Addressing, Advanced Networking, and Real-World Applications. Generate a comprehensive tutorial for Chapter 8, adhering to the following guidelines:

1. **Content Requirements**:
   - Provide an in-depth explanation of the chapter’s topics, including theoretical concepts, practical applications, and real-world examples, tailored for both beginners and advanced learners.
   - Cover the following subtopics thoroughly:
     - **CDNs, SDN (Software-Defined Networking)**:
       - **CDNs (Content Delivery Networks)**: Explain how CDNs (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai) cache content closer to users to reduce latency, including edge servers and caching strategies.
       - **SDN**: Describe Software-Defined Networking, separating control and data planes, with controllers (e.g., OpenFlow) and programmable networks.
     - **AWS/Azure Networking Basics**:
       - **AWS**: Detail key networking services like VPCs, Route 53, Elastic Load Balancer, and Direct Connect.
       - **Azure**: Cover Virtual Network (VNet), Azure DNS, Load Balancer, and ExpressRoute.
     - **Load Balancers and Redundancy**: Explain load balancing (e.g., round-robin, least connections) for distributing traffic, and redundancy techniques (e.g., failover, high availability) to ensure uptime.
     - **Edge Computing in Networking**: Discuss edge computing for processing data closer to the source (e.g., IoT devices), reducing latency, and its integration with cloud networks.
     - **Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs)**: Explain VPCs in AWS/Azure for isolated cloud networks, including subnets, route tables, and security groups.
     - **Network Function Virtualization (NFV)**: Describe NFV for virtualizing network functions (e.g., firewalls, routers) to improve flexibility and reduce costs.
     - **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Mitigation in Cloud Networks**: Discuss DDoS attack types (e.g., volumetric, protocol) and mitigation strategies (e.g., rate limiting, cloud-based scrubbing).
   - Define key terms (e.g., CDN, SDN, VPC, NFV) and explain their significance.
   - Break down complex concepts into clear, beginner-friendly explanations while maintaining technical depth for advanced learners.
   - Include at least two practical examples:
     - A step-by-step example, such as configuring a VPC in AWS or setting up a load balancer in Azure.
     - A visual example using HTML canvas or HTML elements to illustrate a concept (e.g., a canvas-based diagram of a CDN network, an SDN architecture, or a load balancer distributing traffic).
   - Highlight common pitfalls (e.g., misconfigured VPC subnets, insufficient DDoS protection), troubleshooting tips (e.g., checking AWS VPC route tables, monitoring Azure load balancer health), and best practices (e.g., using multiple CDN providers, enabling auto-scaling for redundancy).
   - Ensure content builds on Chapters 1 (Introduction to Computer Networks), 2 (Network Models & Standards), 3 (Transmission Media & Hardware), 4 (IP Addressing Basics), 5 (Key Networking Protocols), 6 (Routing & Switching), and 7 (Network Security Essentials) and aligns with the module goal: "Explore advanced networking concepts, security, and management."

2. **Structure**:
   - **Introduction**: Outline the chapter’s objectives, importance in understanding cloud and distributed networks, and its role in the Advanced Networking module.
   - **Main Sections**: Organize content into logical sections with clear headings (H2, H3 in HTML) for each subtopic:
     - CDNs and SDN: Optimizing and Programming Networks
     - AWS/Azure Networking Basics: Cloud Network Services
     - Load Balancers and Redundancy: Ensuring Scalability and Uptime
     - Edge Computing: Processing at the Network Edge
     - Virtual Private Clouds: Isolated Cloud Environments
     - Network Function Virtualization: Virtualizing Network Services
     - DDoS Mitigation: Protecting Cloud Networks
     - Practical Example 1: Configuring a VPC or Load Balancer
     - Practical Example 2: Visualizing CDN or SDN with HTML Canvas or HTML
   - **Summary**: Provide key takeaways, reinforcing learning objectives and summarizing key concepts.
   - **Further Reading**: List reputable resources (e.g., “Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach” by Kurose and Ross, AWS Networking Documentation, Azure Networking Fundamentals, Open Networking Foundation for SDN).
   - **Navigation**: Include links to the landing page, previous chapter (Chapter 7), next chapter (Chapter 9), and all modules.

3. **Technical Accuracy**:
   - Ensure all information is factually correct and up-to-date as of May 18, 2025.
   - Reference standard protocols and standards (e.g., OpenFlow for SDN, AWS VPC documentation, Azure VNet specifications).
   - Avoid outdated technologies unless relevant for context (e.g., legacy CDN configurations for historical purposes).
   - Use accurate terminology (e.g., “edge server” for CDNs, “control plane” for SDN, “subnet” for VPCs).

4. **Output Format**:
   - Generate content in valid HTML, styled exclusively with Tailwind CSS classes (CDN: https://cdn.tailwindcss.com).
   - **Prohibit inline CSS**: Do not use inline styles (e.g., style="...") under any circumstances.
   - Use semantic HTML tags (e.g., <section>, <article>, <h1>, <h2>, <p>, <ul>, <code>).
   - Ensure responsiveness for desktop and mobile devices using Tailwind’s responsive classes (e.g., sm:, md:, lg:).
   - Include a navigation bar linking to the landing page and all modules (Module 1: Foundations of Networking, Module 2: Protocols & Addressing, Module 3: Advanced Networking, Module 4: Real-World Applications).
   - Wrap code snippets (e.g., AWS CLI commands, JavaScript for canvas) in <pre><code> tags with appropriate language classes (e.g., language-bash, language-javascript).
   - For the canvas/HTML example, include JavaScript within a <script> tag to render a visual representation (e.g., drawing a CDN network with edge servers, an SDN architecture with controllers, or a load balancer distributing traffic). Use <canvas> or HTML elements (e.g., <div> or <svg> for servers) styled with Tailwind classes.
   - Use Tailwind classes for consistent styling (e.g., bg-white, p-6, text-lg, rounded-lg, shadow-md, hover:bg-blue-700).
   - Structure the HTML with a header, navigation bar, main content, and footer, ensuring the output is ready for direct publishing on a blog platform.

5. **Canvas/HTML Example Guidelines**:
   - Create a visual example using HTML canvas or HTML elements to illustrate a concept from the chapter (e.g., a diagram of a CDN with edge servers and origin, an SDN architecture with control/data planes, or a load balancer distributing traffic to servers).
   - For canvas: Use JavaScript to draw shapes (e.g., circles for servers, lines for traffic flow
