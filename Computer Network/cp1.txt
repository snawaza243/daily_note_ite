You are an expert in computer networks and technical writing, tasked with creating a detailed tutorial chapter for a blog series titled "Computer Networks: From Scratch to Mastery." The series is designed for CSE graduates and professionals, covering 12 chapters across 4 modules: Foundations of Networking, Protocols & Addressing, Advanced Networking, and Real-World Applications. Generate a comprehensive tutorial for Chapter 1, adhering to the following guidelines:

1. **Content Requirements**:
   - Provide an in-depth explanation of the chapter’s topics, including theoretical concepts, practical applications, and real-world examples, tailored for both beginners and advanced learners.
   - Cover the following subtopics thoroughly:
     - **Definition**: Define a computer network, its purpose, and key components (e.g., nodes, links, protocols).
     - **Advantages**: Explain benefits like resource sharing, scalability, communication efficiency, and cost savings, with examples.
     - **Network Types**: Detail LAN (Local Area Network), WAN (Wide Area Network), MAN (Metropolitan Area Network), and PAN (Personal Area Network), including their characteristics, scope, and use cases.
     - **Network Topologies**: Describe Star, Mesh, Bus, and Ring topologies, including their structure, advantages, disadvantages, and real-world applications. Include text-based descriptions of diagrams for each topology (e.g., ASCII art or detailed textual layout for HTML rendering).
     - **Real-World Applications**: Explore applications in IoT (e.g., smart homes), cloud computing (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud), and VPNs (e.g., secure remote access), with examples of their network requirements.
   - Define key terms (e.g., network, topology, protocol) and explain their significance.
   - Break down complex concepts into clear, beginner-friendly explanations while providing technical depth for advanced learners.
   - Include at least one practical example, such as a step-by-step guide to setting up a basic LAN using Packet Tracer or a similar tool.
   - Highlight common pitfalls (e.g., misconfiguring network types), troubleshooting tips (e.g., checking connectivity), and best practices (e.g., choosing the right topology).
   - Ensure content aligns with the module goal: "Understand core concepts, models, and physical infrastructure."

2. **Structure**:
   - **Introduction**: Outline the chapter’s objectives, importance in the context of computer networks, and its role in the Foundations of Networking module.
   - **Main Sections**: Organize content into logical sections with clear headings (H2, H3 in HTML) for each subtopic:
     - What is a Computer Network?
     - Advantages of Computer Networks
     - Types of Networks (LAN, WAN, MAN, PAN)
     - Network Topologies (Star, Mesh, Bus, Ring)
     - Real-World Applications (IoT, Cloud, VPNs)
     - Practical Example: Setting Up a Simple LAN
   - **Summary**: Provide key takeaways, reinforcing learning objectives and summarizing key concepts.
   - **Further Reading**: List reputable resources (e.g., “Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach” by Kurose and Ross, Cisco Networking Academy, RFC 1180).
   - **Navigation**: Include links to the landing page, next chapter (Chapter 2), and all modules.

3. **Technical Accuracy**:
   - Ensure all information is factually correct and up-to-date as of May 18, 2025.
   - Reference standard protocols, IEEE standards, or industry practices where applicable (e.g., IEEE 802.3 for Ethernet).
   - Avoid outdated technologies unless relevant for historical context (e.g., Token Ring for topologies).
   - Use accurate terminology (e.g., “nodes” for devices, “links” for connections).

4. **Output Format**:
   - Generate content in valid HTML, styled exclusively with Tailwind CSS classes (CDN: https://cdn.tailwindcss.com).
   - **Prohibit inline CSS**: Do not use inline styles (e.g., style="...") under any circumstances.
   - Use semantic HTML tags (e.g., <section>, <article>, <h1>, <h2>, <p>, <ul>, <code>).
   - Ensure responsiveness for desktop and mobile devices using Tailwind’s responsive classes (e.g., sm:, md:, lg:).
   - Include a navigation bar linking to the landing page and all modules (Module 1: Foundations of Networking, Module 2: Protocols & Addressing, Module 3: Advanced Networking, Module 4: Real-World Applications).
   - Wrap code snippets (e.g., Packet Tracer steps, configuration commands) in <pre><code> tags with appropriate language classes (e.g., language-text, language-bash).
   - Use Tailwind classes for consistent styling (e.g., bg-white, p-6, text-lg, rounded-lg, shadow-md, hover:bg-blue-700).
   - Structure the HTML with a header, navigation bar, main content, and footer, ensuring the output is ready for direct publishing on a blog platform.

5. **Tone and Style**:
   - Use a professional, engaging tone suitable for a technical tutorial series.
   - Define jargon clearly (e.g., LAN, topology) and maintain consistency in terminology across the series.
   - Write for clarity, avoiding ambiguity, and cater to both beginners and advanced learners.

6. **Chapter Details**:
   - Module: Module 1: Foundations of Networking
   - Chapter Title: Introduction to Computer Networks
   - Chapter Number: Chapter 1
   - Topics to Cover:
     - Definition of computer networks, purpose, and components.
     - Advantages: Resource sharing, scalability, communication efficiency, cost savings.
     - Network types: LAN, WAN, MAN, PAN (characteristics, scope, use cases).
     - Network topologies: Star, Mesh, Bus, Ring (structure, pros, cons, applications).
     - Real-world applications: IoT (smart homes), cloud computing (AWS, Google Cloud), VPNs (secure remote access).
   - Learning Objectives:
     - Understand the definition and purpose of computer networks.
