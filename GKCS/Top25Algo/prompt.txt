Now, for each algorithm, generate a complete HTML blog post with the following structure and rules:

ðŸ§© Structure & Formatting Requirements

Each blog post should be self-contained and follow this structure:

<div class="itepost-section-title">Algorithm Name</div>
<div class="itepost-section-content">
  <p><strong>Category:</strong> Category Name (with color mentioned)</p>
  
  <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Write a clear and beginner-friendly explanation of the algorithm â€” what it does, where it is used, and why it matters.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Working Principle:</strong> Explain step-by-step how the algorithm works, using plain English and (optionally) flow or pseudocode representation.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Example & Dry Run:</strong> Include a small, easy-to-understand example showing how the algorithm processes input to produce output.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Time and Space Complexity:</strong> Provide Big-O notation for best, average, and worst cases, along with memory usage explanation.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Implementation in Multiple Languages:</strong></p>
  
  <pre><code class="language-c">C Code Example</code></pre>
  <pre><code class="language-cpp">C++ Code Example</code></pre>
  <pre><code class="language-csharp">C# Code Example</code></pre>
  <pre><code class="language-java">Java Code Example</code></pre>
  <pre><code class="language-python">Python Code Example</code></pre>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">JavaScript Code Example</code></pre>
  
  <p><strong>Practice Idea:</strong> Suggest a simple practice exercise or variation that helps learners test their understanding.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Real-world Applications:</strong> Mention some practical use cases of the algorithm in software development, AI, data structures, or optimization problems.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Summary:</strong> End with a short summary emphasizing the importance of mastering this algorithm.</p>
</div>

ðŸŽ¯ Goal:

To help learners master each algorithm step-by-step through well-explained, easy-to-practice, and language-diverse examples.
Each post should be standalone and focused on one algorithm only. The writing tone should be simple, educational, and beginner-friendly, but technically accurate.
