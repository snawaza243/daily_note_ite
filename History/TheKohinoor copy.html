        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Kohinoor diamond, whose name means "Mountain of Light," is perhaps the world's most famous and
            controversial gemstone. With a history spanning over 700 years, this legendary diamond has passed
            through the hands of Indian maharajas, Persian shahs, Afghan rulers, and British monarchs, leaving
            behind tales of power, betrayal, and an alleged curse that has fascinated historians and gemologists
            alike.</p>

            <p><em>The Kohinoor diamond as it appears today in the British Crown Jewels</em></p>
        </div>

        <p>This article explores the complete journey of the Kohinoor from its discovery in 1306 to the
            present-day international dispute over its ownership, examining both the historical facts and the
            persistent legends surrounding this remarkable gem.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Origins: Golconda's Treasure</h2>
        <p>The Kohinoor's story begins in the Golconda region of present-day Andhra Pradesh, India, which was
            the world's only known source of diamonds until the 18th century.</p>

        <h3>Discovery and Early History</h3>
        <div class="timeline">
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <span class="timeline-year">1306</span>
                <p>The diamond was discovered by miners using the ancient placer mining technique near the
                    Krishna River. Weighing an astonishing 793 carats (about 158.6 grams), it was immediately
                    recognized as extraordinary due to its exceptional clarity (what we now call D-grade).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <span class="timeline-year">1306-1323</span>
                <p>The Kakatiya dynasty rulers became the first documented owners of the diamond. They placed it
                    in the left eye of their goddess Bhadrakali at a temple in Warangal, where rumors of a curse
                    first emerged:</p>
                <div class="quote">
                    "Whoever possesses this diamond will rule powerfully, but bad luck will follow them. Only
                    God and women can wear it without harm."
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Scientific Evidence of Origin</h3>
        <p>Modern research supports the Indian origin of the Kohinoor:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Geological studies:</strong> The diamond matches characteristics of Golconda diamonds
                (Type IIa with no nitrogen impurities)</li>
            <li><strong>Satellite imagery:</strong> Shows kimberlite pipes in the Kollur mines matching the
                diamond's composition</li>
            <li><strong>Historical records:</strong> The 2023 Journal of Earth System Science published findings
                confirming its Golconda origin</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Turbulent Journey Through Empires</h2>
        <p>The Kohinoor's path through history reads like an adventure novel, marked by wars, betrayals, and the
            rise and fall of empires.</p>

        <div class="timeline">
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <span class="timeline-year">1323</span>
                <p>Alauddin Khilji's general Malik Kafur defeated the Kakatiya dynasty and took the diamond to
                    the Delhi Sultanate. Soon after, the Khilji dynasty collapsed amid violent succession
                    struggles.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <span class="timeline-year">1526</span>
                <p>Babur acquired the diamond after defeating Ibrahim Lodi. He called it the "Babur Diamond" and
                    famously claimed it could "feed all the people in the world for one day."</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <span class="timeline-year">1544</span>
                <p>Humayun gave the diamond to Persian Shah Tahmasp after seeking refuge. This marked the first
                    time the Kohinoor left India.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <span class="timeline-year">1739</span>
                <p>Nadir Shah of Persia acquired the diamond from Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah Rangila through a
                    clever turban exchange, exclaiming "Kohinoor!" when he saw it - giving the diamond its
                    current name.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <span class="timeline-year">1813</span>
                <p>Maharaja Ranjit Singh obtained the diamond from Shah Shuja Durrani of Afghanistan after
                    helping him regain his throne. The Sikh ruler cherished the gem, wearing it on his arm.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>The "Curse" of the Kohinoor</h3>
        <p>Throughout its history, the diamond's owners often met tragic fates:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Alauddin Khilji was murdered by his own general</li>
            <li>Nadir Shah was assassinated shortly after acquiring the diamond</li>
            <li>Three successive Sikh rulers who possessed it died within four years</li>
            <li>British PM Robert Peel died the day the diamond reached England</li>
            <li>Queen Victoria was attacked the day she received it</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This pattern led to the enduring superstition that the Kohinoor brings misfortune to male owners,
            which is why it's now only worn by female British royals.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The British Acquisition and Modern Controversy</h2>
        <p>The diamond's journey to Britain and the subsequent ownership dispute represents one of the most
            contentious chapters in its history.</p>

        <h3>Transfer to British Hands</h3>
        <div class="timeline">
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <span class="timeline-year">1849</span>
                <p>After defeating the Sikh Empire, the British made 10-year-old Maharaja Duleep Singh sign the
                    Treaty of Lahore, which included Article 3 transferring the Kohinoor to Queen Victoria.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <span class="timeline-year">1850</span>
                <p>The perilous journey to England aboard HMS Medea was marked by cholera outbreaks and storms.
                    Upon arrival, a series of strange coincidences (including the Prime Minister's death) fueled
                    the curse legend.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <span class="timeline-year">1852</span>
                <p>Prince Albert had the diamond recut to improve its brilliance, reducing it from 186 carats to
                    its current 105.6 carats (21.12 grams).</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="controversy-box">
            <h3>The Ongoing Ownership Dispute</h3>
            <p>Multiple nations have claimed the Kohinoor since India's independence:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>India:</strong> Argues it was taken under duress during colonial rule and represents
                    cultural heritage</li>
                <li><strong>Pakistan:</strong> Claims it as Lahore's heritage (capital of the Sikh Empire when
                    taken)</li>
                <li><strong>Afghanistan:</strong> Points to its time with the Durrani Empire</li>
                <li><strong>Iran:</strong> Notes its period in Persian possession</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The British maintain legal ownership through the Treaty of Lahore and argue that repatriation
                would set a precedent emptying museums worldwide.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Legal Challenges and Roadblocks</h3>
        <p>India's attempts to reclaim the diamond have faced several obstacles:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The Antiquities and Art Treasures Act (1972) doesn't apply to items taken before 1972</li>
            <li>The UNESCO Convention only covers items removed after 1970</li>
            <li>Multiple claimant nations complicate the issue</li>
            <li>British courts have dismissed claims, stating they can't order foreign governments</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Despite these challenges, public pressure in India continues, with periodic government efforts to
            reopen negotiations.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion: More Than Just a Diamond</h2>
        <p>The Kohinoor represents far more than its considerable monetary value. It embodies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A tangible connection to India's pre-colonial history and craftsmanship</li>
            <li>The complex legacy of British imperialism</li>
            <li>Ongoing debates about cultural repatriation</li>
            <li>The enduring power of myth and superstition</li>
        </ul>

        <p>As historian William Dalrymple noted: "The Kohinoor's story mirrors the history of conquest in India
            - each new wave of invaders seeking to possess both the land and its most famous jewel."</p>

        <div class="quote">
            "If five powerful wrestlers threw stones in all four directions and one toward the sky, then
            whatever distance was covered—if filled with gold—even that wouldn't equal the value of the
            Kohinoor."<br>
            - Wafa Begum to Maharaja Ranjit Singh, 1813
        </div>

        <p>Whether the diamond will ever return to India remains uncertain, but its story continues to captivate
            people worldwide, ensuring the Kohinoor's legacy endures far beyond its physical form.</p>
