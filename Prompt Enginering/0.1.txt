om on learning new skill. so i have find a roadmap form online source"1. Basic LLM Concepts
Understanding the fundamentals of LLMs is essential before working with prompts.

What are LLMs?
Large Language Models are AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data to generate human-like responses.
Types of LLMs
Includes models like GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and open-source alternatives like Llama 2.
How are LLMs Built?
Trained using transformer architectures, fine-tuned with reinforcement learning (RLHF).
Vocabulary
Key terms: tokens, embeddings, inference, fine-tuning, etc.
2. Introduction to Prompting
Basic Prompting
Simple queries like "Explain quantum computing in simple terms."
Need for Prompt Engineering
Well-structured prompts improve accuracy, reduce errors, and get better responses.
3. Writing Effective Prompts
3.1 Writing Good Prompts
Best practices to craft high-quality prompts:

Use delimiters (e.g., """, ---) to separate instructions from input.
Ask for structured output (JSON, XML, HTML) for machine-readable responses.
Include style information to modify the tone of output (e.g., "Write in a formal tone").
Give conditions to the model and ask if they are verified
Provide examples (few-shot prompting) to guide the model.
Specify steps (Chain of Thought) for complex reasoning.
Instruct model to work out its own solution before giving answers.
Iterate and refine prompts based on outputs.
3.2 Prompting Techniques
Role Prompting – "Act as a Python expert and explain list comprehensions."
Few-Shot Prompting – Provide examples before asking the question.
Chain of Thought (CoT) – Ask the model to "think step-by-step."
Zero-Shot CoT – Simply adding "Let's think step by step" improves reasoning.
Least-to-Most Prompting – Break complex tasks into smaller sub-questions.
Dual Prompt Approach – Use two prompts: one for planning, another for execution.
Combining Techniques
3.3 Parts of a Prompt
A well-structured prompt includes:

Instruction (what you want the model to do)
Context (background information)
Input Data (the text to process)
Output Format (how the answer should be structured)
4. Real-World Usage Examples
Practical applications of prompt engineering:

Structured Data – Extract tables from text or convert unstructured data into JSON.
Inferring – Sentiment analysis, summarization, topic extraction.
Writing Emails – Draft professional emails with the right tone.
Coding Assistance – Debug, explain, or generate code snippets.
Study Buddy – Simplify complex topics or generate quizzes.
Designing Chatbots – Create AI assistants with predefined behaviors.
5. Pitfalls of LLMs
Common issues and how to mitigate them:

Citing Sources
Hallucinations – Models generate false information.
Bias – Responses may reflect training data biases.
Math Errors – LLMs struggle with precise calculations.
Prompt Hacking – Malicious inputs can manipulate outputs.
6. Improving Reliability
Prompt Debasing – Reduce bias by explicitly instructing neutrality.
Prompt Ensembling – Use multiple prompts and aggregate results.
LLM Self-Evaluation – Ask the model to verify its own answers.
Calibration – Adjust settings like temperature for consistency.
Math
7. LLM Settings
Key parameters to control model behavior:

Temperature (0 = deterministic, 1 = creative)
Top-P (controls response diversity)
Max Tokens – Limit response length.
Other Hyperparameters
8. Image Prompting (for AI Art Models)
For models like DALL·E or Midjourney:

Style Modifiers – "Cyberpunk, neon-lit cityscape."
Quality Boosters – "Ultra HD, 8K, detailed."
Weighted Terms – Emphasize elements with ::word::2.
Fix Deformed Generations – Use --no [hands] to avoid errors.
9. Prompt Hacking & Security
Prompt Injection – Malicious inputs altering behavior.
Prompt Leaking – Extracting system prompts.
Jailbreaking – Bypassing safety filters.
Defensive Measures – Input sanitization, moderation layers.
Ofensive Measures"

but I have to lear everything about this including all the major and minor topic related to this .

I have to learn in the form of theory and for practice l need example and for all this, I am going to use ai tool to generate the content also that contetwill be a proper way sequence form. 

that cont I need need in HTML form so I could post over my blog site by which I will learn from that also other can learn.

So suggest me to write a prompt to get this content in HTML form with detailed explanation and but correct information. that prompts can be unit wise and subunit wise
