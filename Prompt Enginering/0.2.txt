Prompt for Generating Comprehensive LLM Learning Content in HTML
Here's a structured prompt you can use to generate detailed HTML content for your blog, broken down by units and subunits as per your roadmap:

markdown
I'm creating an educational blog series about Large Language Models and prompt engineering. I need comprehensive, well-structured HTML content that covers both theoretical concepts and practical examples. For each section, provide:

1. Detailed explanation of the concept
2. Clear examples demonstrating the concept
3. Proper HTML formatting with semantic tags (article, section, h2-h4, code blocks, etc.)
4. Visual hierarchy with appropriate headings
5. Code blocks where applicable with syntax highlighting
6. Comparison tables when explaining different concepts
7. Practical tips or best practices
8. Potential pitfalls or common mistakes

Format the response as complete HTML documents for each major unit, starting with:

---
**For Unit 1: Basic LLM Concepts**

Create an HTML blog post covering:
- What LLMs are (definition, how they differ from other AI)
- Major types of LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama 2) with comparison table
- How LLMs are built (transformer architecture, training process, RLHF)
- Key vocabulary (tokens, embeddings, inference, fine-tuning) with definitions
- 2-3 practical examples showing these concepts in action
- "Did you know?" fact boxes with interesting trivia
- FAQ section at the end addressing common beginner questions

Use this HTML structure:

For Unit 2: Introduction to Prompting

Create an HTML blog post covering:

What is prompting (basic definition)

Examples of simple prompts vs. complex prompts

Why prompt engineering matters (accuracy, efficiency benefits)

Basic prompt structure breakdown

3-5 practical examples showing prompt evolution from simple to complex

Common beginner mistakes section

Interactive exercise for readers (with solution hidden in details tag)

[Follow similar HTML structure as above with appropriate sections]


For subsequent units, follow the same pattern, adjusting the content focus accordingly. For each unit, you can send a separate prompt like:

**For Unit 3.1: Writing Good Prompts**

Create an HTML blog post covering:
- All listed best practices for writing good prompts
- Multiple examples for each technique (delimiters, structured output, etc.)
- Before/after examples showing ineffective vs effective prompts
- Common pitfalls section
- Practice exercises with toggle-able solutions
- Reference cheat sheet in a sidebar-style div

[HTML structure with specialized sections for each technique]
Would you like me to generate the complete HTML content for any particular unit as an example? I can start with Unit 1 or whichever you'd prefer to see first.
