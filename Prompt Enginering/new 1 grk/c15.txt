Create a detailed, accurate, and up-to-date HTML page for a learning module titled "Emerging Trends in LLMs and Prompt Engineering" as part of a comprehensive course on Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompt engineering. The content must be correct, in-depth, and suitable for learners with a beginner-to-intermediate understanding of AI, building on prior chapters. Use HTML with inline Tailwind CSS (via CDN) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity or visualizations. Follow these requirements:

1. **Content Requirements**:
   - Cover the following topics in detail:
     - **Advancements in LLM Architectures**: Discuss recent developments in LLM architectures (e.g., improvements beyond transformers, hybrid models) as of May 2025, with examples of their impact on prompt engineering.
     - **Multi-Modal LLMs**: Explain the rise of models integrating text, images, and other data, with examples of prompts for multi-modal applications.
     - **Automated Prompt Engineering Tools**: Describe emerging tools or frameworks for automating prompt design (e.g., prompt optimization algorithms), with examples of their use.
     - **Personalized and Contextual Prompting**: Discuss trends in tailoring prompts to individual users or dynamic contexts, with examples of adaptive prompts.
     - **Energy-Efficient LLMs**: Explore advancements in reducing the computational footprint of LLMs, with examples of prompts optimized for efficiency.
     - **Ethical and Regulatory Trends**: Highlight evolving ethical guidelines and regulations (e.g., AI Act updates as of 2025) affecting prompt engineering, with examples of compliant prompts.
     - **Future Directions**: Discuss potential future trends in LLMs and prompt engineering (e.g., real-time learning, decentralized models), keeping content grounded in current evidence as of May 2025.
   - Include at least two code examples (e.g., Python scripts using an LLM API like Hugging Face’s Transformers or xAI’s API to demonstrate a cutting-edge prompting technique, such as multi-modal prompting or automated prompt optimization).
   - Provide a visual representation using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript to illustrate a concept (e.g., a diagram of a multi-modal LLM workflow or a timeline of emerging trends).

2. **Styling Requirements**:
   - Use Tailwind CSS (via CDN) for responsive, modern styling.
   - Structure the page with a header, navigation bar, main content section, and footer.
   - Ensure the design is clean, with a focus on readability (e.g., use appropriate font sizes, spacing, and color contrasts).
   - Style code snippets with a monospaced font and syntax highlighting effect using Tailwind classes.
   - Make the canvas visualization interactive (e.g., hover effects or clickable elements to reveal explanations of each trend).

3. **Interactivity Requirements**:
   - Include JavaScript to add interactivity, such as buttons to toggle between examples of new prompting techniques, show/hide code outputs, or animate the canvas visualization (e.g., simulating a multi-modal workflow).
   - Ensure the JavaScript is lightweight and compatible with modern browsers.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output must be a single, complete HTML file with inline Tailwind CSS and JavaScript.
   - The content must be wrapped in appropriate HTML semantic elements (e.g., `<article>`, `<section>`).
   - Include a title, meta tags for responsiveness, and a favicon link.
   - Ensure all code is functional and error-free.

5. **Additional Instructions**:
   - Verify that all information is accurate and up-to-date as of May 2025, avoiding outdated references (e.g., don’t mention deprecated APIs or speculative future developments).
   - Use clear, concise language suitable for learners, with examples to illustrate complex concepts.
   - Structure the content with headings, subheadings, and bullet points for clarity.
   - Avoid speculative or unverified information about LLMs or emerging trends.
   - Ensure the content is engaging and practical, preparing learners to stay current with LLM advancements.
   - For xAI API-related queries, redirect to https://x.ai/api for details, without speculating on pricing or specifics.

Output the complete HTML code, including all content, styling, and interactivity, as a single file.
