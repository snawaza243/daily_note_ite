Create a detailed, accurate, and up-to-date HTML page for a learning module titled "Deploying LLMs in Production" as part of a comprehensive course on Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompt engineering. The content must be correct, in-depth, and suitable for learners with a beginner-to-intermediate understanding of AI, building on prior chapters. Use HTML with inline Tailwind CSS (via CDN) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity or visualizations. Follow these requirements:

1. **Content Requirements**:
   - Cover the following topics in detail:
     - **LLM Deployment Overview**: Explain the process of deploying LLMs in production environments, including API integration and cloud-based solutions, with examples of deployment scenarios.
     - **Prompt Engineering in Production**: Discuss how to design and manage prompts for consistent performance in production, with examples of production-ready prompts.
     - **Scalability and Performance**: Describe techniques for scaling LLM applications (e.g., load balancing, caching), with examples of handling high request volumes.
     - **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Explain how to monitor LLM performance (e.g., latency, accuracy) and handle errors in production, with examples of monitoring setups.
     - **Security in Production**: Discuss securing LLM deployments against prompt injection and data leaks, building on Chapter 11, with examples of secure configurations.
     - **Cost Optimization**: Describe strategies to minimize computational costs (e.g., efficient prompt design, model quantization), with examples of cost-saving techniques.
     - **User Feedback Integration**: Explain how to incorporate user feedback to improve prompts and model performance in production, with examples of feedback loops.
   - Include at least two code examples (e.g., Python scripts using an LLM API like Hugging Face’s Transformers or xAI’s API to demonstrate a production-ready prompt or a monitoring script for LLM outputs).
   - Provide a visual representation using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript to illustrate a concept (e.g., a diagram of an LLM deployment pipeline or a flowchart of monitoring and feedback processes).

2. **Styling Requirements**:
   - Use Tailwind CSS (via CDN) for responsive, modern styling.
   - Structure the page with a header, navigation bar, main content section, and footer.
   - Ensure the design is clean, with a focus on readability (e.g., use appropriate font sizes, spacing, and color contrasts).
   - Style code snippets with a monospaced font and syntax highlighting effect using Tailwind classes.
   - Make the canvas visualization interactive (e.g., hover effects or clickable elements to reveal explanations of each deployment component).

3. **Interactivity Requirements**:
   - Include JavaScript to add interactivity, such as buttons to toggle between examples of production prompts or monitoring setups, show/hide code outputs, or animate the canvas visualization.
   - Ensure the JavaScript is lightweight and compatible with modern browsers.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output must be a single, complete HTML file with inline Tailwind CSS and JavaScript.
   - The content must be wrapped in appropriate HTML semantic elements (e.g., `<article>`, `<section>`).
   - Include a title, meta tags for responsiveness, and a favicon link.
   - Ensure all code is functional and error-free.

5. **Additional Instructions**:
   - Verify that all information is accurate and up-to-date as of May 2025, avoiding outdated references (e.g., don’t mention deprecated APIs or deployment practices).
   - Use clear, concise language suitable for learners, with examples to illustrate complex concepts.
   - Structure the content with headings, subheadings, and bullet points for clarity.
   - Avoid speculative or unverified information about LLMs or deployment techniques.
   - Ensure the content is engaging and practical, preparing learners to deploy LLMs effectively in real-world applications.
   - For xAI API-related queries, redirect to https://x.ai/api for details, without speculating on pricing or specifics.

Output the complete HTML code, including all content, styling, and interactivity, as a single file.
