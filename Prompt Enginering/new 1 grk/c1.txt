Create a detailed, accurate, and up-to-date HTML page for a learning module titled "Understanding the Fundamentals of Large Language Models (LLMs)" as part of a comprehensive course on LLMs and prompt engineering. The content must be correct, in-depth, and suitable for learners with a beginner-to-intermediate understanding of AI. Use HTML with inline Tailwind CSS (via CDN) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity or visualizations. Follow these requirements:

1. **Content Requirements**:
   - Cover the following topics in detail:
     - **What are LLMs?**: Explain Large Language Models as AI systems trained on vast text data to generate human-like responses, including their purpose and capabilities.
     - **Types of LLMs**: Discuss models like GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and open-source options like Llama 2, including their key differences and use cases.
     - **How are LLMs Built?**: Describe transformer architectures, pre-training, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF).
     - **Vocabulary**: Define key terms like tokens, embeddings, inference, fine-tuning, attention mechanism, and context window.
     - **Applications of LLMs**: Highlight real-world applications (e.g., chatbots, content generation, translation).
     - **Ethical Considerations**: Address potential ethical issues like bias, misinformation, and environmental impact of training LLMs.
   - Include at least one code example (e.g., a Python snippet showing tokenization or a simple API call to an LLM like Hugging Face’s Transformers).
   - Provide a visual representation using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript to illustrate a concept (e.g., a simplified transformer architecture diagram or tokenization process).

2. **Styling Requirements**:
   - Use Tailwind CSS (via CDN) for responsive, modern styling.
   - Structure the page with a header, navigation bar, main content section, and footer.
   - Ensure the design is clean, with a focus on readability (e.g., use appropriate font sizes, spacing, and color contrasts).
   - Style code snippets with a monospaced font and syntax highlighting effect using Tailwind classes.
   - Make the canvas visualization interactive (e.g., hover effects or clickable elements to reveal explanations).

3. **Interactivity Requirements**:
   - Include JavaScript to add interactivity, such as a button to toggle the visibility of the code example or to animate the canvas visualization.
   - Ensure the JavaScript is lightweight and compatible with modern browsers.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output must be a single, complete HTML file with inline Tailwind CSS and JavaScript.
   - The content must be wrapped in appropriate HTML semantic elements (e.g., `<article>`, `<section>`).
   - Include a title, meta tags for responsiveness, and a favicon link.
   - Ensure all code is functional and error-free.

5. **Additional Instructions**:
   - Verify that all information is accurate and up-to-date as of May 2025, avoiding outdated references (e.g., don’t mention deprecated models or techniques).
   - Use clear, concise language suitable for learners, with examples to illustrate complex concepts.
   - Structure the content with headings, subheadings, and bullet points for clarity.
   - Avoid speculative or unverified information about LLMs (e.g., don’t assume details about unreleased models like Grok 3.5).

Output the complete HTML code, including all content, styling, and interactivity, as a single file.
