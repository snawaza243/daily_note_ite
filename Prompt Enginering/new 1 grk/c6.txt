Create a detailed, accurate, and up-to-date HTML page for a learning module titled "Real-World Usage Examples" as part of a comprehensive course on Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompt engineering. The content must be correct, in-depth, and suitable for learners with a beginner-to-intermediate understanding of AI. Use HTML with inline Tailwind CSS (via CDN) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity or visualizations. Follow these requirements:

1. **Content Requirements**:
   - Cover the following topics in detail:
     - **Structured Data**: Explain how to use prompts to extract tables from text or convert unstructured data into formats like JSON, with examples of prompts and their outputs.
     - **Inferring**: Describe applications like sentiment analysis, summarization, and topic extraction, including example prompts and results.
     - **Writing Emails**: Discuss crafting professional emails with specific tones (e.g., formal, persuasive), with example prompts and email outputs.
     - **Coding Assistance**: Explain how to use prompts for debugging, explaining, or generating code snippets, with examples (e.g., generating a Python function or debugging a code error).
     - **Study Buddy**: Describe using prompts to simplify complex topics or generate quizzes, with examples of simplified explanations or quiz questions.
     - **Designing Chatbots**: Discuss creating AI assistants with predefined behaviors using prompts, with an example of a chatbot prompt and its behavior.
     - **Content Generation**: Explain how to use prompts for creating blog posts, articles, or social media content, with an example prompt and output.
     - **Data Analysis Support**: Describe using prompts to assist with data interpretation or generating insights, with an example prompt for analyzing a dataset.
     - **Prompt Engineering Workflow**: Discuss how to iterate and refine prompts for these real-world tasks, including tips for testing and improving outputs.
   - Include at least two code examples (e.g., Python scripts using an LLM API like Hugging Face’s Transformers to demonstrate real-world applications, such as extracting JSON from text or generating a code snippet).
   - Provide a visual representation using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript to illustrate a concept (e.g., a diagram showing the workflow of a prompt for structured data extraction or a visualization of sentiment analysis results).

2. **Styling Requirements**:
   - Use Tailwind CSS (via CDN) for responsive, modern styling.
   - Structure the page with a header, navigation bar, main content section, and footer.
   - Ensure the design is clean, with a focus on readability (e.g., use appropriate font sizes, spacing, and color contrasts).
   - Style code snippets with a monospaced font and syntax highlighting effect using Tailwind classes.
   - Make the canvas visualization interactive (e.g., hover effects or clickable elements to reveal explanations of each application).

3. **Interactivity Requirements**:
   - Include JavaScript to add interactivity, such as buttons to toggle between examples of different applications, show/hide code outputs, or animate the canvas visualization.
   - Ensure the JavaScript is lightweight and compatible with modern browsers.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output must be a single, complete HTML file with inline Tailwind CSS and JavaScript.
   - The content must be wrapped in appropriate HTML semantic elements (e.g., `<article>`, `<section>`).
   - Include a title, meta tags for responsiveness, and a favicon link.
   - Ensure all code is functional and error-free.

5. **Additional Instructions**:
   - Verify that all information is accurate and up-to-date as of May 2025, avoiding outdated references (e.g., don’t mention deprecated APIs or techniques).
   - Use clear, concise language suitable for learners, with examples to illustrate complex concepts.
   - Structure the content with headings, subheadings, and bullet points for clarity.
   - Avoid speculative or unverified information about LLMs or prompting techniques.
   - Ensure the content is engaging and practical, demonstrating real-world applications to prepare learners for advanced use cases.

Output the complete HTML code, including all content, styling, and interactivity, as a single file.
