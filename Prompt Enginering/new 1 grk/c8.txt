Create a detailed, accurate, and up-to-date HTML page for a learning module titled "Improving Reliability" as part of a comprehensive course on Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompt engineering. The content must be correct, in-depth, and suitable for learners with a beginner-to-intermediate understanding of AI. Use HTML with inline Tailwind CSS (via CDN) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity or visualizations. Follow these requirements:

1. **Content Requirements**:
   - Cover the following topics in detail:
     - **Prompt Debiasing**: Explain how to reduce bias in LLM outputs by using neutral prompts or explicit instructions (e.g., "Provide a neutral response"), with examples of biased vs. debiased outputs.
     - **Prompt Ensembling**: Describe using multiple prompts to generate responses and aggregating results (e.g., majority voting or averaging), with an example showing improved reliability.
     - **LLM Self-Evaluation**: Discuss prompting the model to verify its own answers (e.g., "Check your response for accuracy"), with examples of self-evaluation prompts and outcomes.
     - **Calibration**: Explain how to adjust settings like temperature (e.g., 0 for deterministic, 1 for creative) and top-p to improve response consistency, with examples showing different settings’ effects.
     - **Improving Mathematical Accuracy**: Describe techniques to enhance LLM math performance, such as breaking down problems, using external tools, or prompting for step-by-step reasoning, with examples of math prompts and outputs.
     - **External Validation**: Discuss cross-checking LLM outputs with external sources or tools (e.g., fact-checking APIs or calculators), with examples of validation processes.
     - **Prompt Refinement Iterations**: Explain how to iteratively refine prompts based on output quality, with examples of initial vs. improved prompts.
     - **Handling Ambiguity**: Describe strategies for clarifying ambiguous inputs or tasks (e.g., rephrasing or adding context), with examples of ambiguous vs. clarified prompts.
   - Include at least two code examples (e.g., Python scripts using an LLM API like Hugging Face’s Transformers to demonstrate techniques like prompt debiasing or self-evaluation, showing improved reliability).
   - Provide a visual representation using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript to illustrate a concept (e.g., a diagram showing the prompt ensembling process or a flowchart of self-evaluation steps).

2. **Styling Requirements**:
   - Use Tailwind CSS (via CDN) for responsive, modern styling.
   - Structure the page with a header, navigation bar, main content section, and footer.
   - Ensure the design is clean, with a focus on readability (e.g., use appropriate font sizes, spacing, and color contrasts).
   - Style code snippets with a monospaced font and syntax highlighting effect using Tailwind classes.
   - Make the canvas visualization interactive (e.g., hover effects or clickable elements to reveal explanations of each reliability technique).

3. **Interactivity Requirements**:
   - Include JavaScript to add interactivity, such as buttons to toggle between examples of reliable vs. unreliable outputs, show/hide code outputs, or animate the canvas visualization.
   - Ensure the JavaScript is lightweight and compatible with modern browsers.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output must be a single, complete HTML file with inline Tailwind CSS and JavaScript.
   - The content must be wrapped in appropriate HTML semantic elements (e.g., `<article>`, `<section>`).
   - Include a title, meta tags for responsiveness, and a favicon link.
   - Ensure all code is functional and error-free.

5. **Additional Instructions**:
   - Verify that all information is accurate and up-to-date as of May 2025, avoiding outdated references (e.g., don’t mention deprecated APIs or techniques).
   - Use clear, concise language suitable for learners, with examples to illustrate complex concepts.
   - Structure the content with headings, subheadings, and bullet points for clarity.
   - Avoid speculative or unverified information about LLMs or reliability techniques.
   - Ensure the content is engaging and practical, preparing learners to improve LLM performance in real-world scenarios.

Output the complete HTML code, including all content, styling, and interactivity, as a single file.
