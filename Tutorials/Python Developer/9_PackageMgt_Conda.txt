Topic: Conda (Expanded Master Outline)
1. Environment Management
Core Operations

Creating environments (`conda create -n env_nconda create -n env_name)

Specifying Python versions (python=3.9)

Cloning environments (--clone)

Exporting/recreating envs (environment.yml)

Advanced Control

Environment isolation with --prefix

--prune flag (removing unused packages)

Managing environment locations (conda info --envs)

Environment variables in Conda (conda env config vars)

Best Practices

Naming conventions for environments

Directory structure for project-specific envs

Environment size optimization

2. Channel Management
Fundamentals

Default channels (conda-forge, defaults)

Adding/removing channels (conda config --add channels)

Channel priority (channel_priority in .condarc)

Advanced Topics

Private channels (self-hosted/Artifactory)

Channel mirrors for offline use

Pinning packages from specific channels

Security & Performance

Channel trust verification

Avoiding channel conflicts

Local channel caching

3. Conda vs Pip
Feature Comparison

Aspect	Conda	Pip
Non-Python Dependencies	✅ Handles binaries (C libs)	❌ Python-only
Environment Isolation	✅ Built-in	❌ Needs venv/virtualenv
Dependency Resolution	✅ More robust	❌ Can conflict
Interoperability

Using pip inside Conda envs (risks and guidelines)

conda-lock vs pip-tools for deterministic builds

Converting requirements.txt to Conda format

When to Use Which

Data science stacks → Conda

Pure Python packages → Pip

Hybrid approaches (conda env export --from-history)

4. Dependency Management
Advanced Resolution

Dependency conflicts troubleshooting

--freeze-installed flag

Forcing reinstalls (--force-reinstall)

Reproducibility

conda list --explicit (exact build specs)

conda-pack for relocatable environments

Docker integration strategies

5. Performance Optimization
Conda parallel download (-q/--quiet flags)

Mamba as a drop-in faster alternative

Cleaning caches (conda clean --all)

6. Edge Cases & Troubleshooting
SSL errors in corporate environments

Solving inconsistent environment states

Handling CondaHTTPError
