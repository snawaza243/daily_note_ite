1. Arrays (Memory-Oriented Deep Dive)
Core Concepts
Memory layout: Contiguous allocation, cache locality

Time complexities:

markdown
| Operation | Big-O |
|-----------|-------|
| Access    | O(1)  |
| Search    | O(n)  |
| Insertion | O(n)  |
| Deletion  | O(n)  |
Advanced Implementations
Dynamic arrays (Python list internals):

Growth factor strategies (Java: 1.5x, Python: ~1.125x)

Amortized O(1) append analysis

Multidimensional arrays:

Row-major vs column-major storage

Strided access patterns

Engineering Applications
NumPy ndarrays (vectorized operations)

Circular buffer (stream processing)

In-place algorithms (rotation, partitioning)

2. Linked Lists (Pointer-Level Mastery)
Type-Specific Optimizations
Type	Pros	Cons	Use Case
Singly	Minimal memory	No reverse traversal	FIFO queues
Doubly	Bidirectional traversal	2x pointer overhead	LRU cache
Circular	Ring buffer logic	Complex termination	Round-robin scheduling
Memory-Level Operations
Pointer swapping patterns:

python
# Reversing a linked list
prev, current = None, head
while current:
    next_node = current.next
    current.next = prev  # Pointer flip
    prev, current = current, next_node
Dummy node techniques (edge case reduction)

Production Considerations
Memory fragmentation in long-running systems

Pool allocators for high-frequency trading systems

Lock-free concurrent variations

3. Hash Tables (Industrial-Grade Implementation)
Collision Resolution Benchmarks
Method	Load Factor	Worst Case	Best Case	Implementation Example
Chaining	0.75	O(n)	O(1)	Java HashMap
Open Addressing	0.5	O(n)	O(1)	Python dict
Advanced Hashing Techniques
Cryptographic hashing (SHA-256 for distributed systems)

Consistent hashing (Cassandra/DynamoDB)

Cuckoo hashing (O(1) worst-case lookup)

Python-Specific Optimizations
Dict internals (compact vs combined table)

Hash randomization (security against DoS)

Custom hashing (__hash__ protocol):

python
class User:
    def __hash__(self):
        return hash((self.id, self.__class__))
Comparative Analysis
When to Choose Which
Structure	Ideal Use Case	Production Example
Array	Matrix operations, CPU caching	Pandas DataFrames
Linked List	Frequent inserts/deletes	Blockchain implementations
Hash Table	Key-value lookups	Redis database
Memory Footprint Analysis

| Structure   | 1M Elements | Overhead Factor |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Array       | ~8MB        | 1x              |
| Linked List | ~32MB       | 4x              |
| Hash Table  | ~16MB       | 2x              |
